# Invisible XML (ixml) Exercise 1

Let's start with [this plain text document representing data about Pokemon moves from generation 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newtfire/textAnalysis-Hub/refs/heads/main/Class-Examples/invisible_xml/pokemon-moves-gen5.txt). You can follow the link to download and save this directly, or use `git pull` on the main branch of  the textAnalysis-Hub/Class-Examples/invisible_xml/pokemon-moves-gen5.txt. Save it in a folder with your personal repo / homework to work on together

The file has newlines and tab characters giving it a clear structure. The first 13 lines are meant to be column headers, but were formatted differently. The rest of the file uses tab characters to provide information about:
*  the **name** of a move 
*  the **type** of a move
*  the **category** (cat.) of a move
*  the **power** of a move (in digits) 
*  the **accuracy** (acc.) of a move (in digits)
*  the **power points** (pp) of a move (in digits)
*  the **effect** of a move.
