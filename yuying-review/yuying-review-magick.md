# ImageMagick Review

I have reviewed Rachel's ImageMagick tutorial. This is an easy to follow tutorial. It introduces a command-line tool ImageMagick, which can generate  thumbnail in batches or individually. 

ImageMagick provides many commands, while this tutorial mainly refers to the usage of **convert** and **mogrify**. All sample codes works well. 

This tutorial provides a lot of detailed guidance. For example, the property **mogrify** needs output source, and users need to create an output file before outputting, or shell will hint no such file or directory. Also, this tutorial mentions that ImageMagick is case sensitive. Sometimes, users collect images files whose format is either uppercase or lowercase, so users are recommended to run the sequence twice, one with uppercase and the other with lowercase while keeping the output the same. 

The suggestion for this tutorial is adding descriptions for the sample images, so that readers can learn how the image  generates . Also, remind readers that restart git bash if they open git bash before download ImageMagick.
