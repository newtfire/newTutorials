        <h2 id="installations"><em>Installations</em></h2>
        <ul><li>Before we dive into making our awesome 3D website, we need to install <code>Node.js</code> and
            <code>npm</code>
            at the command line.
        </li>
            <li>We strongly recommend writing your code in <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/">JetBrains' WebStorm</a>,
                which we will explore as an alternative
            to the oXygen XML Editor for working intensively on JavaScript projects.</li>
        </ul>

       <!-- <ul>
            <li><strong>Hot tip</strong>: Assuming you're reading this because you're in one of Dr. B's classes, you're
                probably using oXygen as your code editor. oXygen is really great for working with XML, XSLT, and many
                other
                XML-based languages - but for languages like Javascript, where methods and functions are hard to
                remember
                for beginners, oXygen does not provide very good syntax highlighting and helpful suggestions as you
                code.
            </li>
            <li><strong>FOR THIS REASON</strong>, we recommend downloading <a
                    href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual
                    Studio Code</a> to develop your three.js websites in. It's completely free, and it is simply the
                best
                for writing Javascript. You'll never want to write Javascript in any other code editor ever again.
                (Sorry
                Dr. B lol)</li>
            <li>you dont <em>neeeeed</em> VS Code to make your Three.JS website... but I'm tellin ya, it's just way
                better.
                You'll see what I mean.</li>

        <h3 id="install-nodejs"><strong>Install Node.js</strong></h3>
        <p><b><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.JS</a></b> is what makes the Javascript world go round.</p>
        <p>&quot;As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network
            applications.&quot; <em>-Node.JS devs</em></p>
        <p>Before downloading Node.JS, you should check to see if you already have it installed in your machine.
            To do this, we will open our Command Line.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hot tip part 2:</strong> VS code actually has a command line terminal built into the editor that
                you
                can use as well:</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="imgWrap"><img class="img" src="images/screenshots/VScodeTerminal.jpg" alt="VS code terminal"></div>
        <ul>
            <li>Enter this command to check if you already have Node.JS Installed:
                <pre>  node -v
        </pre>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you already have Node.JS installed, the terminal will print a version number that looks something like
            this:
            <code>v0.10.35</code>
        </p>
        <p>If your terminal didn't print a version number, you need to go<b>
                <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">download
                    Node.JS</a>
            </b>. (Don't worry, it's completely free - and if you really want to get into Javascript on any
            level, including professionally, Node.JS is a must-have.)</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3 id="install-npm"><strong>Install NPM</strong></h3>
        <p>Now that you have Node.JS installed, allow me to introduce you to the wonderful world of the <strong><a
                    href="https://www.npmjs.com/">Node Package Manager (NPM)</a></strong> community. NPM allows
            brilliant
            developers to write awesome open-source Node.JS package modules that will allow you to do super cool things
            with
            Javascript, including make 3D websites. We need to install NPM at the command line in order to install the
            Three.JS package.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First, check to see if you already have NPM installed:</li>
        </ul>
        <pre>npm -v
        </pre>
        <p>Again, similar to when we checked for node.js, a version number will print if you already have npm installed.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If not, you need to install it. We can do this at the command line with this command:</li>
        </ul>
        <pre>

            npm install -g npm
   
    </pre>
        <p>Now you're all set to create your new project repository!</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3 id="create-an-empty-project-directory-and-install-vite"><strong>Create an empty project directory, and
                install
                VITE</strong></h3>
        <p>Once you have made your project directory, open the command line at your empty directory and enter this
            command:
        </p>
        <pre>
            npm init vite
        </pre>
        <p>Follow the prompts given at command line:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>name your project</li>
            <li>name your package (press enter for default)</li>
            <li>select <code>vanilla</code> framework (yellow)</li>
            <li>select <code>Javascript</code> for the language (yellow)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This will create some new files in your directory. <bold>On Windows and the arrow keys don't work?</bold>
        Switch to Windows Powershell or Windows terminal, navigate to your project folder and enter the same commands.
        </p>


        <p>Now, enter these commands <i>separately</i>. The command line terminal prompts these for you when you create
            your Vite app:</p>
        <pre>
          cd your-project-name
        </pre>
        <pre>
           npm install
        </pre>
        <div class="imgWrap">
            <img class="img" src="images/screenshots/setting-up-vite-CMD.jpg" alt="command line vite setup screenshot" />
        </div>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 id="install-threejs-at-command-line"><b>Install Three.JS at command line</b></h2>
        <p>First, make sure you are at the root level of your Vite project directory. Once you <code>cd</code> into it,
            enter this command:</p>
        <pre>

                npm install --save three
             
        </pre>
        <p>This will install Three.JS as a dependency in your project. You should see a new <code>node_modules</code>
            directory, a <code>package.json</code> file, and a
            <code>package-lock.json</code> file.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>DO NOT TOUCH THESE THINGS</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These files and directory contain dependencies that NPM automagically generates for you. Humans do not need
            to
            touch them directly, and should never touch them for any reason at all - <em>or you'll destroy the
                planet</em>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>

        <h1 id="how-to-view-your-site-locally">HOW TO VIEW YOUR SITE LOCALLY</h1>
        <p>Since Three.JS requires dependencies in order to render, you need to tell your app to run in the command line
            in order to view it locally.</p>
        <p>In the command line terminal, run this command:</p>
        <pre>
           npm run dev
        </pre>
        <div class="imgWrap">
            <img class="img" src="images/screenshots/npm-run-dev.jpg" alt="static dev server runnning" />
        </div>
        <p>
            Click the link to your <code>https://localhost:3000</code> dev server to preview your app, and voila! Your
            Vite project
            is set up and running locally.
        </p>


        <p>
            When you run the command <code>npm run dev</code>, whenever you make new edits to your code, your localhost
            browser will automatically refresh and
            reflect your changes.
            <ab>
                You will not be able to enter any new commands into your terminal until you kill the localhost serve
                process.
            </ab>
        </p>
        <p>
            To "kill" or end your dev server process in your command line terminal, simply enter <b>CTRL + C</b> (or CMD
            + C on Mac) in the terminal.
        </p>
        <p>It will ask you if you want to "Terminate Batch Job". To confirm, type <code>y</code> and hit enter.</p>

    <section>
        <h2 id="write-your-html">Write your HTML</h2>
        <p>You'll need three basic elements in your HTML to render your 3D world:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> with a unique <code>@id</code> that will literally act as the canvas for
                your 3D
                objects to live in.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot; src=&quot;./main.js&quot;&gt;</code> to connect your HTML to
                your
                Javascript file with all fo the 3D instructions inside it.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;main&gt;</code> to hold the text contents that will float on top of your 3D environment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should already have the <code>index.html</code>, <code>main.js</code>, and <code>style.css</code> files
            you will use to edit in your project, which were generated when you initialized your new Vite app.</p>
        <p>
            Go into your index.html file and change it to look like this:

        <p>In the same directory as your index.html file, you should find a CSS file called <code>style.css</code>.
            Write
            the following code into that CSS to make the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element in your HTML be the
            background
            for your site:</p>
        <pre>canvas{
          position:fixed;

        <p>This is where your 3D objects will appear when we start creating them in your javascript.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1 id="javascript-time">Javascript Time!</h1>
        <p>In your new <code>main.js</code> javascript file, you'll need to tell it to import the Three.JS node package
            module in order to reference the many pre-built 3D-building methods and objects.</p>
        <p>To do this, simply paste these <code>import</code> instructions on the first line of your JS file:</p>
        <pre>import * as THREE from 'three';
        </pre>
        <h2 id="scene-setup">Scene Setup</h2>
        <p><a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene">Helpful Three.JS
                documentation in case you need it</a></p>
        <p>You need three main components to set up your Three.JS scene:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a new scene</li>
            <li>a camera</li>
            <li>a renderer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We create these objects by declaring a new <code>const</code>, a type of variable in Javascript, and defining
            it
            with new THREE methods.</p>
        <pre>// Setup
        
        const scene = new THREE.Scene();
        
        const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
        
        
        // create a new renderer by instating the canvas element in our HTML // file
        const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
          canvas: document.querySelector('#bg'),
        });
      </pre>
        <p>You will not be able to view your new scene until you tell the renderer to render the scene and the camera
            with
            Three.js's <code>.render</code> method:</p>
        <pre>renderer.render(scene, camera);
        </pre>
        <p>Now that we have each of these objects set as constants, we can manipulate them with Three.JS's built-in
            methods.
        </p>
        <p>Let's set the pixel ratio, the size, and the camera position:</p>
        <pre>renderer.setPixelRatio(window.devicePixelRatio);
        renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
        camera.position.setZ(50);
        camera.position.setX(-3);
        
       </pre>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="create-your-first-object">Create your first object!</h2>
        <p>Now that our scene is set up, we can add 3D objects!</p>
        <p>There are three basic components you need in order to create a 3D object in Three.JS:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the geometry</li>
            <li>the material</li>
            <li>the mesh (combining the geometry and the material)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We need to create new <code>const</code> variabels for each of these components so that we may manipulate
            them
            and add the final mesh to our scene.</p>
        <p>Let's create a basic cube.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The dimensions of the length, width, and height of your box go inside the new THREE geometry object
                parentheses <code>()</code> as arguments separated by commas:</li>
        </ul>
        <pre>const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(10, 10, 10);
        
        //set the color of the basic material in the object parameters `{}`
        
        const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0xFF6347 } );
        
        const cube = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
        </pre>
        <p>To add our cube into the scene, use the <code>.add()</code> method.</p>
        <pre>scene.add( cube );

        <h2 id="manipulating-your-object">Manipulating your object</h2>
        <p>You can change the position of the object by manipulating the cube's <code>.position</code> property and
            attaching the axis on which you want to move it:</p>
        <pre>cube.position.z = -15;
        cube.position.x = -15;
        </pre>
        <p>Change the rotation of your object by manipulating the <code>.rotation</code> property and attaching the axis
            on
            which you wish to rotate it:</p>
        <pre>cube.rotation.x = 2;
        cube.rotation.y = .5;
        </pre>

        <h2 id="lights-and-material-types">Lights and Material Types</h2>
        <p>Three.JS allows you to create objects with a wide variety of customizable material types and textures. Some
            material types require lights in the scene in order to be visible, including the <code>Phong</code>
            material.
            Your cube is visible because it is made of a <code>Basic</code> material, which is not affected by lights.
        </p>
        <p>Let's create a new object to test out new materials:</p>
        <pre>const ico = new THREE.IcosahedronGeometry(10);
        const icoMaterial = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
        const icoMesh = new THREE.Mesh(ico, icoMaterial);
        
        scene.add(icoMesh);
        
        icoMesh.position.z= -15;
        icoMesh.position.x= 15;
        </pre>
        <p>If you try to view your new object in the browser, you will not be able to see it. Since Phong materials
            require
            light, you will need to at least one light object in your scene:</p>
        <pre>// Lights
        
        const pointLight = new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff);
        pointLight.position.set(0, -10, 10);
        
        const ambientLight = new THREE.AmbientLight(0xffffff);
        ambientLight.position.set(25, -15, -400);
        
        scene.add(pointLight);
        scene.add(ambientLight);
        </pre>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Point Lights are lights that only go in one direction.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Ambient lights act more like the sun, spreading light in all directions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can change the color of the light by manipulating the HEX code value of the new THREE.Light()
                    object
                    within the parentheses.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Watch what happens if you change your <code>cube</code> material to a <code>StandardMaterial</code> which
            accepts
            light, replacing it with <code>BasicMaterial</code> , which does not accept light:</p>
        <pre>const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial( { color: 0xFF6347 } );
        </pre>
        <div class="imgWrap"><img class="imgSm" src="images/screenshots/standardMaterial.jpg" alt="standard material cube"></div>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h1 id="animate-your-scene">Animate your scene</h1>
        <p>To make your objects move through time, we need to create a new <code>animate</code> function and set our
            animation properties within it.</p>
        <p>You can animate just about any property of an object you want.</p>
        <pre>function animate() {
            requestAnimationFrame( animate );
        // slowly rotate the cube:
        cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
        cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
        // rotate the icosahedron a little faster in the opposite direction:
        icoMesh.rotation.z += -0.03
        icoMesh.rotation.y += -0.03
        
            renderer.render( scene, camera );
        }
        </pre>
        <p>You must call the animate() function in order to tell the browser to use it:</p>
        <pre>animate();
        </pre>
        <p>Congratulations! Your scene should now look something like this:</p>

        <p>Three.JS comes with a wide variety of scene helpers to assist in orienting the view of your scene.</p>
        <p>We can add a <strong>Light Helper</strong>, which shows us where in the scene our light objects are
            positioned.
        </p>
        <p>Let's add a light helper to our <code>pointLight</code> object:</p>
        <pre>// Helpers
        
        const lightHelper = new THREE.PointLightHelper(pointLight);
        
        scene.add(lightHelper)
        </pre>
        <div class="imgWrap"><img class="img" src="images/screenshots/lightHelper.jpg" alt="light helper"></div>
        <p>We can also add a <strong>Grid Helper</strong> to show the 3D axes of our scene.</p>
        <pre>const gridHelper = new THREE.GridHelper(200,50);
        
        scene.add(gridHelper)
        </pre>

        <h2 id="orbit-controls">Orbit Controls</h2>
        <p>Three.JS has various types of Control methods to allow you to add interactive functionality to your scene.
        </p>
        <p>Let's add an <code>Orbit Control</code>, which will allow us to move our camera and traverse our scene with
            mouse
            controls and zoom.</p>
        <p>In order to add the Orbit Controls as a function, we need to import that package from the three.js
            dependencies.
            At the top of your document where you imported THREE.JS, (directly underneath
            <code>import * as THREE from 'three';</code>) add this line of code:
        </p>
        <pre>import { OrbitControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls';
        </pre>
        <p>Then, under your <code>Helpers</code>, activate your orbit controls by declaring it as a constant:</p>
        <pre>// Orbit Control
        
        const controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement)
        </pre>
        <p>Your orbit controls will not be functional until you add an <code>.update()</code> method to your new
            <code>controls</code> object WITHIN your <code>animate(){}</code> function:
        </p>
        <pre>function animate() {
            requestAnimationFrame( animate );
        // slowly rotate the cube:
        cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
        cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
        // rotate the icosahedron a little faster in the opposite direction:
        icoMesh.rotation.z += -0.03
        icoMesh.rotation.y += -0.03
        // ALLOWS YOUR ORBIT CONTROLS TO UPDATE LIVE IN REAL-TIME:
        controls.update()
        
            renderer.render( scene, camera );
        }
        </pre>
        <p>When you refresh your server, you should now be able to click and drag to orbit the camera view of your
            scene!

        <h2 id="texture-mapping">Texture Mapping</h2>
        <p>In the world of 3D modeling, <code>Texture Mapping</code> refers to mapping flat images onto the surface of a
            3D
            object. Three.JS allows us to do this by creating <code>Texture</code> objects and applying them to our 3D
            objects using methods.</p>
        <p>Find an image file that you'd like to apply to the surface of a new object. We will be using this one:</p>
        <div class="imgWrap"><img class="imgSm" src="images/smile.jpg" alt="smiley face texture"></div>
        <p>Save your texture image file in your <code>/images</code> directory.</p>
        <p>Now, in our <code>main.js</code>, let's create a new texture that we will map onto a new object:</p>
        <pre>// Object texture mapping
        
        const smileTexture = new THREE.TextureLoader().load('images/smile.jpg')
        </pre>
        <p>Now, let's create a new <code>Sphere</code> object to map our new texture onto.</p>
        <p><strong>Remember</strong> new objects require three basic components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a <code>geometry</code></li>
            <li>a <code>material</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>in this case, our new <code>BasicMaterial</code> will have a value of
                        <code>{map: smileTexture}</code> instead of a color hex code.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>a <code>mesh</code>, which combines the <code>geometry</code> and <code>material</code> to create the
                final
                visible object.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre>// Object texture mapping
        
        const smileTexture = new THREE.TextureLoader().load('images/smile.jpg')
        
        const sphereGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry( 10, 22, 10 );
        
        const smileMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({map: smileTexture})
        
        const smileMesh = new THREE.Mesh(sphereGeometry, smileMaterial);
        
        scene.add(smileMesh);

        <p>You can manipulate the object's static position, rotation, and size as you wish, the same as your other
            objects.
        </p>
        <p>You can also add property changes to this new texture to be animated in real-time in your
            <code>animate()</code>
            function:
        </p>
        <pre>function animate() {
            requestAnimationFrame( animate );
        // slowly rotate the cube:
        cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
        cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
        // rotate the icosahedron a little faster in the opposite direction:
        icoMesh.rotation.z += -0.03
        icoMesh.rotation.y += -0.03
        // rotate the smiley sphere on the Y axis:
        smileMesh.rotation.y += 0.05
        controls.update()

        <h3 id="normal-texture-mapping">Normal Texture Mapping</h3>
        <p>Three.JS also allows you to create vivid textures to alter the surface shape of your mesh to create real,
            light-reactive textures on your objects.</p>
        <p>To do this, we need to create a <strong>normal</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Normal mapping</strong> in the 3D world refers to a texture mapping technique used for faking the
            lighting of bumps and dents – an implementation of bump mapping. It is used to add details without using
            more
            polygons.</p>
        <p>To create a normal, you must first find a texture image you like that can be converted into a normal.</p>
        <p>We used this site to generate and customize a texture:
            <a href="http://cpetry.github.io/TextureGenerator-Online/">Texture Generator Online</a>
        </p>
        <p>Here's the texture we generated:</p>
        <div class="imgWrap"><img class="imgSm" src="images\texture.png" alt="texture"></div>
        <p>Now, we must convert this texture image file into a normal map. We used this site to upload our texture image
            file and have it converted into a normal:
            <a href="https://cpetry.github.io/NormalMap-Online/">Normal Map Online</a>
        </p>
        <p>Here's the normal map that was generated from our image:
        </p>
        <div class="imgWrap"> <img class="imgSm" src="images\textureNormal.png" alt="normal map"></div>
        <p>Now we need to create a new <code>normalTexture</code> object in our Javascript by loading a new texture and
            loading in our normalMap image file:</p>
        <pre>const normalTexture = new THREE.TextureLoader().load('images/normals/textureNormal.png');
        </pre>
        <p>Now, to apply our normal map to a new object, we must apply our normal map image to the
            <code>normalMap</code>
            property within our new <code>MeshStandardMaterial</code>.
        </p>
        <pre>// Normal Texture Map
        
        const torusGeo = new THREE.TorusKnotGeometry( 5, 1, 250, 5, 9, 15 );
        const torusMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial( { 
          normalMap: normalTexture,
          roughness: 0,
          metalness: .8
        } );
        
        const torusKnot = new THREE.Mesh( torusGeo, torusMaterial );
        
        scene.add( torusKnot );
        torusKnot.position.y = 20
        
        </pre>
        <p>We also added a <code>roughness</code> and <code>metalness</code> property value to make our new object look
            more
            shiny and reflect light. Your scene should look something like this:</p>
        <div class="imgWrap"><img class="img" src="images/screenshots/normalMapping.jpg" alt="normal mapping"></div>

            How to Deploy your Three.JS App to Github Pages
        </h1>
        <div>
            <p>Now comes the fun part.</p>
            <p>
                To deploy your three.JS app on GitHub Pages and display it to the world, we need to create a production
                folder in your main repository branch, and create a deployment branch that will point directly to your
                static production folder files.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are the steps you must follow:
            </p>
            <h3><b>Step 1</b></h3>
            <p>
                Create a new folder in your project root. Name it <code>dist</code>.
            </p>
            <h3>
                <b>Step 2</b>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Move the following files inside the new <code>dist</code> folder:
                 
            <ul>
                <li>index.html</li>
                <li>style.css</li>
                <li>main.js</li>
                <li>the <code>/images</code> folder containing your image files that you are using for your meshes and
                    scene backgrounds.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>
                <b>Step 3</b>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Within your <code>package.json</code> file, add the fillowing line of code inside your
                <code>"scripts"</code>:

            <pre>
                            "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
                        </pre>

            </p>
            <p>Your <code>"scripts"</code> JSON should now look like this:</p>
            <pre>
            "scripts": {
                "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
                "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
           }
            </pre>

            <h3>
                Step 4
            </h3>
            <p>
                Make sure you are at the root of your project directory. Run the following command in your project to
                install gh-pages:
            </p>
            <pre>
                npm install gh-pages
            </pre>

            <p>
                gh-pages is an npm package that allows you to publish files to a branch named "gh-pages" on GitHub.
                You may read more about it here - https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages

            </p>
            <h3>
                <b>Step 5</b>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Now we just need to push the project to a new repository on GitHub.
                Go to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub.com</a> and create a new repository.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fill in your repository name and a short description. <i>Tip: try naming your remote repo the same as
                    what you named your Three.JS project lcoally.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                You do not need to add a readme, a gitignore, or a license.

                 git init
            </pre>
            <pre>
                 git remote add origin "YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL"
             </pre>
            <pre>
                 git add .
            </pre>
            <pre>
                 git commit -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE"
            </pre>
            <pre>
                  git push origin master
            </pre>

            <h3><b>Step 6</b></h3>
            <p>
                Once all your code is pushed to the master branch, go to your repo on GitHub.com
                and create a new branch. <b>Name it “<code>gh-pages</code>”.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Make sure you are at the root of your project directory, then run this command in your terminal:
            </p>
            <pre>
                 npm run deploy
            </pre>
            <p>
                This step runs the “deploy” script that you added in Step 3.
            </p>
            <div class="imgWrap">

                <img class="img" src="images/screenshots/npm-run-deploy-publish.jpg" alt="npm run deploy gh-pages" />

            </div>
            <p>
                Once your terminal says "Published", you need to wait a few minutes for your GitHub Pages site to be
                ready for viewing.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a few minutes, go to the "Pages" tab in your repository settings, and your website link will be
                there.
            </p>
