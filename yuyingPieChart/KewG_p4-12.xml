            it is the top part of the border decoration that takes up the margins as well as the
            bottom half of the page. The designs are flowers and leaves painting in a simplisting,
            scroll-y style with black ink. </description>

        <line n="7"/>gloom of the throat emerged a straight bar, <line n="8"/>rough with

        <description resp="#edm"> At the top of the page, there is a painted arch. On the right,
            there is a bumpy design that falls to about mid-page. On the top left, there are two

            designs with the bumpy design on the right. </description>
        <line n="1"/>The <nature type="plant">petals</nature> were voluminous enough to be stirred

        <nature type="ground">earth</nature> beneath with a <line n="5"/>spot of the most intricate
        colour. The light fell either <line n="6"/>upon the smooth, <color>grey</color> back of a
            <nature type="ground">pebble</nature>, or, the shell <line n="7"/>of a <nature

        that one expected <line n="10"/>them to burst and disappear. Instead, the <nature type="sky"

        and the light now <line n="12"/>settled upon the flesh of a <nature type="plant"
            >leaf</nature>, revealing the branching thread of <line n="13"/>fibre beneath the
        surface, and again it <line n="14"/>moved on and spread its illumination in <line n="15"
        />the vast <color>green</color> spaces beneath the dome of <line n="16"/>the

        <description resp="#edm"> An arch with broad swirls sits on the top margin. A line runs along
            the left and right margins. At the bottom, centered under the text, there are two

        <line n="1"/>Then the <nature type="sky">breeze</nature> stirred rather more briskly
        overhead <line n="2"/>and the colour was flashed into the air above, into <line n="3"/>the
        eyes of the men and women who walk in <nature type="plant">Kew <line n="4"/>Gardens</nature>
        in July. <line n="5"/>The figures of these men and women straggled past the <line n="6"

        <nature type="animal">butterflies</nature> who crossed <line n="8"/>the <nature

        about six inches in front of the woman, strolling care- <line n="10"/>lessly, while she bore
        on with greater purpose, only turning <line n="11"/>her <nature type="human-body"
            >head</nature> now and then to see that the children were <line n="12"/>not too far
        behind. The man kept this distance in front <line n="13"/>of the woman purposely, though
        perhaps unconsciously, <line n="14"/>for he wished to go on with his thoughts. </page>
