## New Orientation for Writing your First iXML

Orient this to a streamlined version of the movieData.xml document. 

Provide guidance on:


*  Special terms in ixml: grammar, terminals, non-terminals, etc.,  pragma?
*  Basic syntax: how to write this grammar. Left side vs. right-side.
*  Unicode characters and lookup
