* Installing Calabash:
    * Get it from here: https://github.com/xmlcalabash/xmlcalabash3/releases/tag/3.0.0-alpha17 and look for the zip file at the bottom of the page after the release notes. The zip directory you need is the third one from the top (named something like this with the version number in the name): **xmlcalabash-3.0.0-alpha17.zip**
