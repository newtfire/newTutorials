1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,350
Hi, Felix.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,110
Hi, Elisa.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,130
Yeah. So we have
started recording.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:16,750
We are redoing portions
of our discussion

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,570
on minimal computing,
this time to

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,070
record them and
hopefully be able to

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,230
work with them. So I
think I'm scrolling

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,710
through here. Oh,
and you have, I see,

9
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,330
already fleshed out
your introduction.

10
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,370
You like that portion,
because I was going

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,450
to start by saying,
Felix, tell us

12
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,330
about your background
with minimal computing,

13
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,850
but I think you've
already got that.

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,410
Yes.

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,250
Where should we begin?

16
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,150
Do you want to talk about

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,550
your experiences
in Nigeria?

18
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:01,010
with minimal, and how
that has influenced

19
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,790
your perspective
on our discussions

20
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,810
of minimal computing
generally. Is

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,410
that a good starting
point? Because

22
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,790
you had a lot to
say, and it was very,

23
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,050
it was very
important, I think,

24
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,830
for this piece
to have that.

25
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,750
I guess that's
a big question.

26
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,350
I think I would like
to begin with the fact

27
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,030
that the concept
of the term minimum

28
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,490
computing, was it a
thing, was not a thing.

29
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,850
If I should talk
retrospectively

30
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,310
from 2017 to 2021,

31
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,130
so maybe what would
be the term would

32
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,750
be lack of funding
lack of resources,

33
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,390
lack of infrastructure,
what do we do?

34
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,390
So I think the
drive sincerely back

35
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,830
then was to get people
to know about DH.

36
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,570
The drive wasn't
really that much about

37
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,830
projects. The drive was
all about human capacity

38
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,710
development it's obvious
not in humanities

39
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,190
alone across sciences
and other disciplines

40
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,670
i'll take a quick example
from sciences where

41
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,030
a phd student in
biochemistry or any of the

42
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,550
sciences would like
to run a lab session

43
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,970
for a dissertation she
or she would need a

44
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,790
chemical and most likely
they buy it from the

45
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,520
west it takes a long
time to ship it down if

46
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,730
that person is unfortunate
to have a pei we

47
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,550
don't call it pei a
supervisor who holds a

48
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,130
lab who has funding who
can buy the chemicals

49
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,790
otherwise they will
have to be in rotation

50
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,530
until one finishes
before the other can come

51
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,090
up so the humanity case
is not out of point

52
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,130
it's a general norm
so but the challenge

53
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:11,590
there would be we don't
know can somebody teach

54
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,970
us to know have an idea
so i think that was

55
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,730
pretty much that was
the background of ddh

56
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,050
in nigeria from my own
perspective the training

57
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,250
purposes let's get
them trained let's

58
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,270
harm them the second
shift which i really think

59
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,570
it's very important
to talk about beyond

60
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,890
the human capacity
development is to train

61
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,550
people to be able to
use dh method in their

62
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:39,250
respective i will call
it traditional research

63
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,030
you know it's a
long journey now

64
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,010
to begin to talk
about dh projects

65
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,690
which humanity um minimal

66
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,630
computing now
becomes very a very

67
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,670
table tool i mean
in terms of um

68
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,130
how do we do the
project this is

69
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,850
not a question
the question is we

70
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,870
don't really know
about dh We want to

71
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,030
know about it.
Now that you know,

72
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,050
let's lay our hands
on a tiny research

73
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,210
within your own
research and make a

74
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:12,010
paper publication
and try Voyant or try

75
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,690
Hong Kong and see
if you can tweak it

76
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,870
with African-American,
Nigerian texts,

77
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,210
Nigerian literature,
and see what happens

78
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,570
in Chinua Achebe's
teens fall apart and see

79
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,130
how you can track places.
that kind of thing

80
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,450
so that was that was
rigorous i really

81
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,990
really want to point
that out the the payoff

82
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,690
for the human capacity
development really

83
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,310
really was a great deal
so we started off from

84
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,610
the scratch um knowing
about it and we scale

85
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,030
up from that i i
could remember vividly

86
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,150
2021 um Professor
Tunde, who happens to be

87
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:58,030
the Center for Digital
Humanities in Lagos,

88
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,990
was able to bring
people from not

89
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,830
only West Africa, I
think West African

90
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,710
and East Africa
early career

91
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,110
researchers to be
trained. Of course,

92
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,990
thanks to the Volkswagen
Foundation or the

93
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,970
German Foundation who
always assist in training

94
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,110
and bringing people
together. and many

95
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,190
from different disciplines
from french from

96
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,970
english from humanities
specific disciplines

97
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:32,570
came on board very excited
to learn very happy

98
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,890
to see wow these two
can do this one this

99
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,490
can turn my research
around and within the

100
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,370
space of i mean a couple
of couple of months

101
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,890
or let's say within
that season what we

102
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,830
noticed of course i am a
product of that noticeable

103
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:57,190
trend many got to
western universities

104
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:03,050
to pursue that knowledge
knowledge drive yeah

105
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,930
yeah so that was it
picked you up and moved

106
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,470
you to new places and
that also helps you

107
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,090
find new methods and
new methods so it feels

108
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,530
like yeah we can't talk
about minimal competing

109
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,550
in the global south
without discussing

110
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,250
the importance of
educating communities first

111
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,170
correct i i you you
you have the right word

112
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,570
it's the community the
community of practice

113
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,390
and you know what
i'm pretty much sure

114
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,810
maybe from your background
in the north that

115
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,470
might be similar there
is this apathy against

116
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:50,270
learning or applying
dh or dh2 or method to

117
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:55,770
our already registered
long term over the

118
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,550
decade traditional
research so the brevity of

119
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:07,010
to share, even when
faculty members

120
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,730
don't like what
he was doing.

121
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,090
Yeah, they don't
want it. He is

122
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,910
a professor of
digital studies,

123
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,310
where you call it
discourse analysis.

124
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,330
And he works with
political discourse of a

125
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,890
particular election
year in 1993, which was

126
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,820
very, very funny. so
he was able to produce

127
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,610
volumes and research in
that area but when he

128
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:37,090
but when he traveled
for his um um alexander

129
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,610
von um experience
researcher fellowship

130
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,490
back then in germany he
was introduced to the

131
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,230
edge so he came back
he felt this is what is

132
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,510
going to happen now i
have to train people

133
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,310
So he became the
first person to be

134
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,800
called a professor
in DH because he

135
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,630
brought everything
down from Germany and

136
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,690
he brought trainer,
coordinator, people

137
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,830
who can actually
assist him. He brought

138
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,670
them down. And he
also learned with

139
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,590
us, with the team
and the community.

140
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,870
He learned together.
He was able to

141
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,970
bring his expertise
on board because

142
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,570
of his connections,
to bring people

143
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,510
to come and train.
Like I mentioned

144
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:30,010
last week, Alex
was down in Lagos.

145
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,590
Ovin was in Lagos.

146
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,310
Dan and Old owner
was in Lagos.

147
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,950
I mean, in person,

148
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,370
Queen did that remotely.

149
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,270
So a lot of people would

150
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,110
want to come
down to teach.

151
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,350
That was the drive,
and that was really

152
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,770
impactful. what we see
um the trend we see

153
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:54,230
afterwards um was one two
three four five number

154
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,230
keeps going on who
went after beyond the

155
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,750
conferences and summer
schools because he runs

156
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,430
summer schools and
winter schools and

157
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,150
conferences then established
through the training

158
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,030
established association
like um like the

159
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,490
acm we have here uh digital
humanity association

160
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,620
of nigeria and that
was the first no

161
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,730
we don't we never had
anyone that was the

162
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,550
first in the training
so so what year was that

163
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,430
about just to put a
pin on that and do you

164
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,930
know do you remember
what year that was when

165
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,990
he had that first
training 2017 yeah so

166
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,850
that's yes we had summer
school we had conferences

167
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,190
uh 2018 the boss who
again gave another

168
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,590
fund we have summer
school 2019 till 2021

169
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,070
the 2021 was a
combination of win either

170
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,470
winter school plus
conference so we can wait

171
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,570
so it was busy with
writing proposal for grants

172
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,050
i need help people
need this people need

173
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,870
to and and the
interesting part of it is

174
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,790
beyond the training
like i mentioned we now

175
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,930
have an association of
th um i think they run

176
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,430
i'm not pretty much
sure if they run a

177
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,530
journal but the association
was established and

178
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,990
the the migration of
people to go to the

179
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,030
west to learn more was
was really really um

180
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:25,330
interesting and from
there we have postdocs

181
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:29,930
going into germany too
through his own manpower

182
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,130
through his own
connections through his

183
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,350
own training and these
product students were

184
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,110
not the age inclined
before they had a taste

185
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,390
of a summer school of
a conference and they

186
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,210
just see oh this is
what i'm doing i'm

187
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,410
being multimode at this
course analysis i can

188
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,470
use it too okay and it
became a postdoctoral

189
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,110
um training for them
outside the country.

190
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,950
And to say the
least, now we have a

191
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,890
subdiscipline branching
out from there, which

192
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,330
is called corpus
linguistics. They also

193
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,590
felt if Professor
Tunde could take this

194
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,550
responsibility to train
people, and they've

195
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,350
been doing some
smaller data analysis,

196
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,810
this set of researchers,
but they felt we

197
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,810
need a broad scale
corpus. And they just

198
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,630
developed um that
subdisciplines um from the

199
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,100
west um discipline of
course linguistics so i

200
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,470
really really want to
point that out i never

201
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,630
i wasn't sure i knew
what of course um

202
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,110
when general came we
heard about minimal

203
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,870
computing but do we really
understand what minimal

204
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,110
computing is do we
have cooperative

205
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,670
projects that we can sit
down together like in

206
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,590
the west you have to
work with other partners

207
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,630
do we have community
partners that we want

208
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,310
to work together um
to work on a project

209
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,530
and begin to think
about what do we have

210
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,610
what approach we take
we we don't have that

211
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,370
what do we need right
what do we need and like

212
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,930
even what we would
be willing to give up

213
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,570
you're just getting
started so that last

214
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,390
question is sort of wait
it's really maybe the

215
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,790
emphasis is on what
do we need and what do

216
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,290
we have what do we
have yeah so the the

217
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,250
approach to the questions
will be different

218
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,830
from one global south
country to another um

219
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,650
and i'm pretty much
sure that's a good

220
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,590
consideration for us to
talk about to really see

221
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,550
um the differences in
approach even up even

222
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,710
when we in times
conceptualize the minimum

223
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,170
computing in the global
south we still have

224
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,730
to understand the
background the cultural

225
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,270
differences and how that
fits into the global

226
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,670
south i think that's
a go start for me i

227
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:41,290
feel like listening to
you describe this um

228
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,630
kind of the the
origins of um digital

229
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:51,990
humanities um from what
all the in in nigeria

230
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,030
and like sort of east
africa right um west

231
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:01,270
africa yeah okay um the
hearing you talk about

232
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,350
that because it was
multiple countries and

233
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,070
many different people
involved, but there's

234
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,130
this organizing effort
and all of those.

235
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,970
One of the questions
that might be directly

236
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,990
relevant to minimal
computing in the

237
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,090
global South is what
do we need to learn?

238
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:26,330
Because the decision
that your mentor had

239
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,490
to make, you know the
decisions that everyone

240
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:32,410
made in that moment
were oh ant conch

241
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,630
is helpful to us or
voyant is helpful as

242
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,670
a starting point and
i remember making a

243
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,190
similar decision it's
not related to your

244
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,690
situation but when new
students are coming

245
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,860
to to learn what is
digital humanities as

246
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,150
undergraduates even
where i am i want them

247
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:55,150
to see oh a computer
can look at text as

248
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,230
a bunch of little
pieces and assemble them

249
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,130
and ant conch is my
favorite i like voyant

250
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,630
too because it's
pretty and it's easy

251
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,470
to use but ant conch
is such a nice little

252
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,610
self-contained system
and it's small and

253
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,290
you can learn how to
customize it you can

254
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,630
learn how to customize
both of those things

255
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,370
and i also liked
working with them

256
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,530
together um to say
look they work very

257
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,830
differently and
you might want to

258
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,370
make a decision
about which one of

259
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,310
these is better for
what you're doing

260
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,790
and like right there
we sort of shook hands

261
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,250
on a particular method
i don't use voyant and

262
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,150
ant conch very much
in my own professional

263
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,830
research but i like
it as a starting point

264
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,150
to show people oh here's
something interesting

265
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,630
you can do with
computers and humanities

266
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,910
research questions so
yeah and the linguistic

267
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,610
side of it is so
important yeah i think

268
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,750
that's that's very
important when we talk about

269
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,650
dh method in this method
used in global stuff

270
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,470
i think it's very
important to point to

271
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,430
that fact that if you
want to train people the

272
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,590
community of practice
the first thing would

273
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:10,030
be what do we train
them um and what how

274
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,010
long can we go for them
to really accumulate

275
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,770
and being able to use
them so i remember um

276
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,870
priestly from canada
also came to train us on

277
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,490
um buoyant and i think
pretty much he brought

278
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:29,230
the book by rockwin
and sinclair a

279
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,830
physical copy we should
cite that in the paper

280
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:40,750
physical copy yeah
physical books so

281
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,230
do you think
why was that so

282
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,950
remarkable that it
was a physical copy

283
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,690
and not just like a
link that you would

284
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:50,010
look at it's I
mean it's amazing

285
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,810
that we do physical
books in digital

286
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:58,810
humanities I guess
yeah like okay so

287
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:06,570
I remember before I
could say I had that

288
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,230
much of the feeling
was when I moved to

289
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,610
Loyola that my center
has a copy. Then I

290
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,690
could grab it. I could
read it. You know,

291
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,030
we talked about that
last week. When you

292
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,670
talked about visiting
the archives, Zit and

293
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,840
Lagos, I don't remember,
but the physical

294
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,210
presence of resources,
you couldn't take

295
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,150
that for granted.
But if it was there,

296
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,350
being able to give
somebody a book or share

297
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,090
it with somebody made
a personal connection

298
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,370
with them or made
it possible for you

299
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,250
to access an archive
that you had to know

300
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,230
the humans involved.
But like, do you

301
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,790
feel like that's also
part of the digital

302
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,910
humanities training
experience is there's

303
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,410
something reliable
about having physical

304
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,770
resources that support
your digital work?

305
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,690
I'm thinking about
that in two ways. First

306
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,170
is the challenge of
having access to resources

307
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,130
would be a major
one. So when you now

308
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,810
see an example, you
want to have that kind

309
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,730
of connection with
the resources, either

310
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,030
manuscripts or textbook,
and you would like to

311
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,790
continue to use them
in such a way that you

312
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,650
know you don't have
access to read again.

313
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,030
So I think the
first thing

314
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,380
is the question
of access.

315
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,750
Access. Access
to funding,

316
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,310
access to resources,

317
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,930
access to textbook,

318
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,370
access to manuscript.
It's a major challenge.

319
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,750
I remember when we
were trained, at that

320
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,990
time, we were asked
to check up Project

321
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:41,170
Gutenberg for copies of
electronic books that

322
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,090
we can download. Because
I remember AntCon

323
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,750
allows .txt files, so
we have to convert the

324
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,130
PDF to .txt. That's
part of the training.

325
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,890
Yeah, you have to learn
document conversion.

326
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:53,990
Yeah.

327
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,570
But now we have the
physical copy. So I

328
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,730
think that's very
important. the second thing

329
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,730
that beyond access
is um this kind of

330
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,570
sustained interest it
gives you kind of sustained

331
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,970
interest when you
have access to the

332
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,430
physical resources like
the manuscripts in the

333
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:16,110
archives beyond the
proposal beyond the

334
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,650
the the hamchair thinking
about you want to

335
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,470
work on the research
in the archive when

336
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,980
you have a touch with
the physical material

337
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,490
the materiality gives
you that kind of

338
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:30,130
sustained interest in
that research it keeps you

339
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,270
awake helps you to
think about it the the

340
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,630
archives of care if
they they are fragile

341
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,690
the archive is or the
material um material

342
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:42,130
effect is this so um i
think the first thing

343
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,150
is the access the
second one is the

344
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,990
sustained interest that
the researcher get close

345
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,050
um get when they
get close to to the

346
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,750
material object so it's
it It kind of shapes

347
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,170
the paradigm of the
traditional discipline.

348
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,070
When we read books,
we do everything,

349
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,610
but this time around,
you have a resource

350
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,490
to go back to like
the human ethical

351
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,190
book. When you
have issues with

352
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,010
and you have a book
by your side, you

353
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,610
can flip through the
pages and use it.

354
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,790
And I think,

355
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,810
I must say this, when
rupico produced the um

356
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:24,210
edited digital black
atlantic um professor

357
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,790
tunde um wrote a chapter
and another scholar

358
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,230
from canada wrote
another chapter i was in

359
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:34,130
nigeria i spoke with
my brother in the u.s

360
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:38,950
paid for a physical
copy i needed a physical

361
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,770
copy so when i moved
in in january that was

362
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,530
my first welcome book
i'm trying to see if i

363
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,870
have my physical copy
here but i got a physical

364
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:52,290
copy of it too it
might be in my office

365
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,190
school mine is in a chef
with me here so when

366
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,110
i visited here it is
oh cool physical book

367
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,770
yeah i want to read
books like this in a

368
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,030
physical form yeah even
though i don't know if

369
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,210
it's hard to get a
digital copy but that's

370
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,670
just it you don't know
if a digital copy is

371
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,770
available for free now
it might be behind a

372
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:17,430
paywall i don't remember
the situation with

373
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,670
this book but you know
it's yeah i have this

374
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:24,510
book right someday
it may be updated and

375
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,570
that's fine but i have
the first one i mean just

376
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,050
to portray the fact
of the fact of access

377
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:35,050
and the sustained
interest i remember paying

378
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,230
in in of course
conversion rate in nigeria

379
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,910
currency for my
brother to keep to

380
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,530
to ship it to my
brother's house in

381
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,990
the u.s and keep it
for me when i came

382
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,710
i grab it this is
my physical copy

383
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,130
it was like my
introduction to

384
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:56,690
masters in dh in
the u.s i have

385
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,870
that physical copy
so when you see

386
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:02,050
when you see that
you want to continue

387
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,610
in that path of
the district where

388
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,300
you have access
to resources which

389
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,110
is a challenge in
the global stuff

390
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,610
access to resources
access to manpower

391
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:16,830
access to manuscript
it's a challenge even

392
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,790
when you think you have
the limited access to

393
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,050
internet the wi-fi
it's still a challenge

394
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:27,170
or limited limited access
i remember was saying

395
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:31,350
this last week to the
the power the power

396
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,970
source you don't have
it all day so it's

397
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,480
still a challenge so
imagine you want to run

398
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,730
some algorithm on your
system and you have to

399
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,370
leave it so you have
to look for whether

400
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,650
it's power source that
can sustain your work

401
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,970
need electricity yeah
and that's not granted

402
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,870
yeah oh it's it's a
lot it's a lot because

403
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:54,230
we've learned to take
up the challenge one

404
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,610
after the other I mean
a little by little of

405
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,390
course minimally and to
also see other resources

406
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,470
beyond the global
south to ask for

407
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,150
resources beyond the global
south I remember 2019

408
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,490
after the trainings
we've had from Lagos

409
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:14,590
Professor Tunde was a
chair within the Adho

410
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,390
2019 conference that
specializes in training

411
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:23,470
african dh so i remember
saying he sent it to

412
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,550
me and other people who
had showed up during

413
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,140
some of the summer
schools and conferences

414
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,170
you guys should apply
he didn't tell us it

415
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,270
was part of the committee
he just told us to

416
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:38,180
apply and we did and
i think six of us or

417
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,990
if not less than six
traveled to to the

418
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:46,070
netherlands to get a whole
one week pre-conference

419
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,670
workshop so we had
one week in lighting

420
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:53,250
2019 before we moved
down to utrecht and the

421
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,330
training we got in in
a week we're able to

422
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:01,010
produce a poster for the
2019 dh conference um

423
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,790
poster session which
was just within one

424
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:10,160
week so it's great that
he did not bring um

425
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,110
trained people brought
people to come and train

426
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:16,730
us he also took us out
to go and experience

427
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,470
the professional
connections the professional

428
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,450
network i remember i
met jeffrey walkway

429
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,590
in person you know
you've read a book you

430
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,270
saw him you know that
conference was over a

431
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,570
thousand or so
participants so it's very

432
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,810
difficult to really grab
people i remember working

433
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,710
with him and asking
him questions you know

434
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,230
very implicitly about
this amenity code is

435
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,590
going on and on and
on so i could see that

436
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:44,370
kind of um his way of
connecting us with the

437
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,470
professional world
beyond the global south

438
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:50,170
practice or struggling
or lack of this or

439
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,970
that so he was able to
ship us out you go have

440
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:57,230
experience to really
see how dh work outside

441
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,570
so that's that's
immensely um important

442
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,670
for me to stress so it
was instrumental yeah

443
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:09,050
it It sounds like
bringing people from West

444
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:13,670
Africa to the Netherlands
wasn't just about,

445
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,330
you know, you're going
to learn these tools

446
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,250
and methods, but it
feels to me, and just

447
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,380
from my own experience
of being at DH

448
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,010
conferences and workshops,
that you have an

449
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,390
opportunity to have a
conversation with the

450
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,370
makers of that tool.
And that if I know

451
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,630
Jeffrey Rockwell, I
bet he started thinking

452
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,030
about some of your
questions and said, oh,

453
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,430
you know, wait, maybe
we should change

454
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,150
the tool a certain way
or maybe we can, you

455
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,530
know, like we have
a new challenge to

456
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:46,190
address with analyzing
texts thanks to what

457
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,810
you're bringing. You
are very, very right,

458
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,370
because we were trained
on the pedagogical

459
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,690
landscape. We're
trained to learn

460
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,870
how DH works in terms
of practice. And I

461
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,510
took up that challenge
because I was teaching

462
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,430
in an undergrad four
-year college. So

463
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,190
I took up that
challenge to also train.

464
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,890
I became not just a
participant in some

465
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,630
of the summer
schools and I became

466
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,770
a coordinator or taking
a session because

467
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:18,090
we can't keep the
pace of hiring

468
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,620
people from outside
again. So the first

469
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,610
two, three sessions
were to train us.

470
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,270
So some of us took
up the challenge to

471
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,730
train. So I became very
invested in training,

472
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,510
buoyant and conch. So
I just have to study

473
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,390
it. Then I can replicate
it with people.

474
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:34,970
And that becomes my
way of reformalizing

475
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,430
some of the systems
that were built

476
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,750
for the North or for
the Western world,

477
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,790
which might not be
correctly amenable

478
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,930
to our own practice
in the global

479
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,750
south. So I have those
kind of questions,

480
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,650
especially formal
questions about

481
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,410
how it might not
be appropriate to

482
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,870
work with our own
local languages.

483
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,350
If it's OK, how do
we tweak it to be

484
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,400
able to work with a
multilingual setting?

485
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,250
Because sometimes
when we use sentences

486
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,730
in Nigeria, for
instance, in English

487
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,850
sentences, it's
always embedded in our

488
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,710
cultural practices. so
you have to you have

489
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,410
to ask again felix
so what do you say

490
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,730
in the last sentence
because i might be

491
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:17,330
hoovering from my
culture and you know but

492
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,210
i'm still expressing
this in english so when

493
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,990
we now begin to harvest
some of the um post

494
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:25,570
post um civil post
-independence literature

495
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,940
or pre-independence
literature in nigeria

496
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,710
before 1960 you might
be shocked that the ant

497
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,530
song of voyant will
bring great patterns

498
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,250
out but you have to
understand the um the

499
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,670
embedded culture within
those constructions um

500
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,150
so it's beyond just
bringing out patterns

501
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:46,390
you have to not see how
like the current llms

502
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,510
what event is would
help us to understand

503
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:52,350
the context beyond um
regular expressions or

504
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,470
keyword search the
keyword search may be very

505
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,970
great the keyword in
context in we aren't

506
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,410
in ant conk is very
great like some words

507
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,410
before and some what
after by seafield there

508
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:06,250
is this disconnect for
from the real culture

509
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,110
of of practice which
brings out the text

510
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:13,490
so it's just way way
way way different but

511
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:16,290
actually making me it's
making me think i wonder

512
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:20,410
is ant conk more
useful than you know

513
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:23,430
like taking a large
language model now for

514
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,150
studying like kind of
multilingual context

515
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,190
because it doesn't make
assumptions. It just

516
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,670
breaks up particles the
way you say to do it.

517
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,310
And then you see, yeah,
I have that hunch,

518
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,150
but I never, you
know, because I don't

519
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,530
work in such a rich
multilingual context as

520
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:42,270
you. Yeah. That
affirms something I

521
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:46,050
wondered because I enjoy
showing my students

522
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,850
what AntConc can do.
And I like that it

523
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,730
seems simple. I know
it isn't, but it's

524
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,790
certainly simpler than
a large language model

525
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,070
where we don't have
as much opportunity

526
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,790
to adjust the way it's
working, right? It

527
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,900
gets like, ooh, the
smaller tool matters.

528
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,690
Yeah. And I think
you're right. We don't

529
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,950
have access to the
black box. We don't have

530
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,030
access to the upper
parameters tuning. We

531
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,190
don't have access to
the training data behind

532
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,590
it. We don't have
access to the power

533
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:19,890
compute imagine do we
have hpc in africa uh

534
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,810
human um high performing
computing that can

535
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,910
handle such yeah i
don't know and then do

536
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,870
we need it you know
do we need it and it's

537
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,730
like maybe the minimal
computing contacts

538
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:34,310
are kind of getting
us to shout wait we're

539
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,570
doing perfectly we're
doing better over here

540
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,990
with these tools
that we can we can do

541
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:42,130
use ourselves yeah
Yeah. We really need it.

542
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,210
Ant Pug's getting a
wonderful shout out.

543
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,110
And so is Boyan. Those

544
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,670
tools are good. Yeah.

545
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:52,730
So now my takeaway is
if I have to not sit

546
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,230
within the concept
of digital humanities

547
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,480
project in Nigeria,
maybe I want to

548
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,390
collaborate. I want to
sit on the board. I want

549
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,870
to come to understand
how people walk.

550
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,070
I'll be the one shouting,
do we need it? Do

551
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,750
we need it? Do we need
it? And that is, of

552
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,890
course, a minimal
competing question. yeah

553
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,610
what do we have what
do we have don't tell

554
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:15,570
me because i'm in the
west i should i should

555
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,290
ask i should stamp
every request what do we

556
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:23,370
have i might be in the
west but we are back

557
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:26,450
at home what do we
have do we have um

558
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:31,170
spreadsheets can we use
um collection builder

559
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:36,250
who with jekyll or can
we use omeka sites to

560
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:40,850
just bring out those
um instances of each

561
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:45,270
page or we use um wakutu
if those are horror

562
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,230
history or collections
from the community

563
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:51,390
what do we have and i
think back to the question

564
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,030
of what do we teach
which might be part

565
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,850
of what minima principles
can be expanded

566
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:59,110
to in the global south
what do we teach we

567
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:02,730
also consider open
access to um to the tools

568
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:06,390
so that's why we went
after aunt kong and

569
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,390
when i because they were
free access you know

570
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,550
that kind of thing so
it's very important

571
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,270
um in doing the h in
the global south either

572
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,570
in practice or in
training or in teaching

573
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:18,350
we also consider what
we teach um because we

574
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,750
want to teach um
tools that method that

575
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,350
people can use after the
training without calling

576
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,490
you again without
asking you for technical

577
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,330
help and without paying
i remember professor

578
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:31,250
tunde was beforehand
from general training

579
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,350
was using sketch engine
which is not free

580
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,670
i mean you can you
can see you can enjoy

581
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,010
the free features but
when you want to do

582
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,770
real work you have to
do so if he has one of

583
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,110
those tools where you
have to you start to

584
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,610
realize its limits
after a while yeah after

585
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:50,150
a while so if he has
the bandwidth to pay um

586
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:54,070
at his own crater
the the community he

587
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,510
brought together don't
have the money to pay for

588
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,720
speech engine so we
have to now streamline

589
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,010
who is coming to train
us on the basis of

590
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:04,410
the open source software
so what do we teach

591
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:07,270
is going to be and a
good important principle

592
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,390
to add to the
global south minimal

593
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,670
computing what do you
teach and i had i had two

594
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,870
ideas here that like
what do we teach is a

595
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,710
new question to add and
also what what do we

596
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,390
need to change about
our tools right because

597
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,550
right because that
conversation as you

598
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,210
begin to use the tools
in your own context that

599
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,750
are different from
the way they were

600
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:32,410
originally written um
the digital humanities

601
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:36,530
tools change maybe become
more efficient maybe

602
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:40,870
handle a greater
complexity of or you know

603
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,810
more use cases as you
introduce them yeah

604
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:47,530
yeah i think it's a
good question to really

605
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:51,310
think about um um what
do we teach and what

606
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:55,250
do we change in the
existing existing and i

607
00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:00,230
think the goal will be
for tools that are um

608
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:04,240
quite working well with
um existing research

609
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,390
paradigms in the
humanities in global south

610
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,930
that would be a good
way to start um see

611
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,630
what you can do which
is before you begin to

612
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:15,070
know the limitation
that this tool doesn't

613
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,970
offer you. So the next
stage will not be to

614
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:22,150
see what we have in
terms of manpower. A CS

615
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,510
professor, an English
professor might need

616
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,250
to come together having
understood how buoyant

617
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,910
can work, but with
the limitation of

618
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,610
multilingual setting or
multilingual languages,

619
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,430
they might need to
come together with a

620
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:42,010
simple page or whatever
tool that would help

621
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,610
them to understand. So
that commitment also is

622
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:48,490
very key. They can
build up some little

623
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,750
structure or systems
that will help them to

624
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,570
now understand their
language and help people

625
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,170
to do research within
that circle. So if we

626
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:01,030
graduate progressively
from what do we teach

627
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:05,070
and what do we have
to what tools do we

628
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:08,270
change, we could actually
gain the manpower or

629
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,870
the expertise to be
able to think critically

630
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:15,730
about software studies,
critical understanding

631
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,030
of softwares and
how those softwares

632
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:24,170
work. And we are not
really keen about the

633
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,670
limitations. We just
wanted to do something

634
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:29,630
for us. But I think
after a while, we might

635
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,360
begin to think about
what are the limitations

636
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,690
based on existing
research we have used it

637
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,970
to carry out in our
own personal research.

638
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,950
And the question we
are asking now in

639
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,950
this research are
not answered, what

640
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:46,090
tool do we need to
change or features?

641
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,990
Before Consuelo
jumps in, I

642
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,710
remember just
an anecdote.

643
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:54,130
I was a fan,
still in the same

644
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,050
space of minimal
computing,

645
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,810
but not called
minimal computing.

646
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,590
I was a fan of
the reference

647
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,210
software management
Mendeley,

648
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:04,990
which is different from
Sotero in the West,

649
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:08,230
it's different from
um um endnote a paid

650
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:12,850
version of the rest i
did that successfully

651
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:16,750
training university
students from school to

652
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:20,490
school because it it
was free i still free

653
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:25,490
and and lcvia acquired
it i remember the

654
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:28,450
question of what to do
we need to change i went

655
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:32,550
during the 2019
conference workshop I went

656
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,710
to Elsevier headquarters
I left my oh my

657
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:39,590
goodness you went and
bearded the tech giants

658
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:42,390
in their lair oh my
god this is wonderful

659
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:46,810
okay and I asked them
we need to make changes

660
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:49,630
in the tour I went
with from Nigeria with

661
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:53,110
a proposal I am the
one training and this

662
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:57,820
is what we found out
can you at me uh-huh

663
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,150
can you make these changes
for africa did they

664
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:04,150
do it i sat with the
tech people you know

665
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,110
it was like a costly
talk um walk walking

666
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,790
you know my host was
able to take me through

667
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:12,470
the different sections
of the tech tech and

668
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:18,110
i was serious like i
need help all the way

669
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,630
from africa i was of
course before that i

670
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,750
was an ambassador for
mentally because i

671
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,210
trained so they support
everything i do with

672
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,630
shipment for merchandise
even when i go to

673
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,590
loyola we still have
this is shipped something

674
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:32,510
back to loyola for me
because loyola i mean

675
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,290
the west don't really
do mendeley like

676
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,670
that so i couldn't
sustain that in the west i

677
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,930
have to write a mail
i said um i mean the

678
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,870
west now i'm not
thinking mendeley will be

679
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:44,750
the thing it's zotero
so yeah zotero is the

680
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,730
one i but i think
once a group of people

681
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:51,930
invests heavily in a
bibliography resource

682
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:56,450
software and then it
does not meet your needs.

683
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:59,450
There's a great
pain to that.

684
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,110
And the pain of
transition is something

685
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:05,230
that people really
get upset about.

686
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:09,730
Do you feel as if
your trip to speak

687
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:12,650
to Elsevier, did
they make any changes

688
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,510
or were they sort
of not listening

689
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,830
in the same way
that like Jeffrey

690
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:18,490
Rockwell would for
making a change.

691
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:22,190
My proposal was
accepted, but

692
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,410
was kept in the
pipeline. They

693
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:27,330
had other features
to roll out.

694
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:31,910
So mine would be a
long time coming. So

695
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,730
they had other features
to roll out from

696
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,230
the tech team, and
they have to prioritize

697
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,670
those features before
attending to my

698
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,280
proposal. That was
2019. And maybe Elsevier

699
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,470
is too big. And so
from the context of

700
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,390
minimal computing,
that like industrial,

701
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,910
like, that's an
interesting perspective

702
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,510
on minimalism
that I don't know

703
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,130
that we talk about
very much. But like

704
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:57,350
your decision to
work with a tool now

705
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,570
might be different
now that you've

706
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,390
had that experience,
right? Correct.

707
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,130
Yeah.

708
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:02,610
Yeah.

709
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,790
The way software is made.

710
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,830
So Consuela, let's sum

711
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:07,870
up a little bit here.

712
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:11,090
Felix has been on fire.
I've just been asking

713
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,390
him little questions.
But we came up with

714
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,950
a couple of questions
to add to the the

715
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,690
minimal computing,
the standard minimal

716
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:20,690
computing list, which
is minimal computing in

717
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:24,070
the global south, like
helps us expand those

718
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:27,090
questions to what do
we need to learn? And

719
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:30,150
what do we learn and
teach? What do we need

720
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,450
to learn and teach?
And what do we need to

721
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,650
change about our tech?
And like those two

722
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,630
things, like that's what
Felix has been going

723
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,050
on about. it's like
well i i went to to

724
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,110
talk to these people
and you've had a couple

725
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,790
of different stories
about that where going

726
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:47,510
to the netherlands
and talking to some dh

727
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,130
developers of voyant
lets you realize oh

728
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:52,070
these people are
approachable and now they're

729
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,930
really interested and
now this is like a

730
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:57,290
scholarly product to
you know keep applying

731
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:00,490
and changing the little
things like voyant

732
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,910
and anconc right like
those things you can

733
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:06,470
talk to the developers
and when a tool is

734
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,970
like run by else severe
you realize it's very

735
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,990
different to talk to
those people yeah so

736
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,130
but then you start to
have as you use the

737
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,350
tools in the global
south and as people are

738
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,630
learning they start to
recognize we need to

739
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,870
make changes so that
this works with the

740
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:24,010
resources we have and
what we need to do so

741
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,170
i guess that's i
think the summary that

742
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,750
was a lot better
than the ai summary

743
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,990
we started this
conversation like hating the

744
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,390
ai summary because
it actually made it

745
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:39,370
really hard to revise
anything you know because

746
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,090
it sounds so
authoritative and it's so

747
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,610
general and it lost all
the little glimmering

748
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:48,710
details and it was just
ah i know i was just

749
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,490
like saying like first
thing the only help

750
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:55,510
you have is a chatbot
which i probably hate

751
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:58,550
it uh because it never
gives you the answer

752
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,250
it's like oh i can
answer that but you will

753
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:03,490
ask me this and it's
like nope i need you

754
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:06,990
to tell us what we
said it is where it is

755
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:10,800
my transcription where
it is my record still

756
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,410
still saying the same
like oh it could take

757
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,330
days to be ready and
it's like nope no no

758
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:20,330
just lost it somewhere
it's somewhere in some

759
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:23,690
cloud maybe Felix do
you remember hearing

760
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:26,470
the little voice saying
recording in progress

761
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:29,330
because I don't know
like yeah yes even

762
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:33,010
on my screen so it did
get recorded yes yes

763
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:35,090
Because I asked you,
did you hear it? And

764
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:37,130
Felix looked at me and
said, yes, I hear it.

765
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,710
And I was like,
okay. Okay,

766
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,890
so that wasn't just me.

767
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,330
I had the recording
thing, because there

768
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:44,410
was two signs. It's
the recording sign,

769
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,480
and it's the sign
of the AI working.

770
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,710
And I have both
of them on.

771
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:51,710
It's on now. I mean,
it's also on right now.

772
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,690
The recording in
progress is on. I don't

773
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,950
have the AI companion
on because I hate it.

774
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:58,290
I actually wonder if
the AI companion itself

775
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,030
interfered with
accessing the recording.

776
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,010
This is a whole
minimal competing

777
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:05,050
question, isn't
it? Yeah. We are

778
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,490
relying on Zoom to
provide a service,

779
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:10,470
and it is concealing
things from us.

780
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,690
Yes.

781
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,210
I must say the only
thing that I really

782
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,130
like, I didn't
try it now, but it

783
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,210
has the possibility
of translating

784
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,470
the notes. I didn't
check how good they

785
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,970
were translated to
other languages,

786
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:24,290
which is something
interesting with AI.

787
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:27,090
It will help sometimes
the miscommunications

788
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,050
that happen with
multilingual culture

789
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:33,690
backgrounds. yeah felix
was talking about that

790
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:37,750
too which we'll see
like multilingual text

791
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,250
analysis when the
conversation is meant

792
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,810
to have two languages
in it is tough for ai

793
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:47,910
sometimes yeah yeah
so yeah i i don't know

794
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,650
it's so i try to
like get as much as

795
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,250
information i was able
i was like give me like

796
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:57,050
points when like what
people said don't give

797
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,370
me like a general idea
that's that's when

798
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:03,430
i uh the like then like
elisa said and felix

799
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,890
said and like i can
assume our use points

800
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,890
exactly this could
guide us throughout the

801
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:12,010
discussion kind of we
we and and i suppose we

802
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,710
have a question of
like you know how much

803
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,790
of this document that
i'm looking at over on

804
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,730
the screen will we want
to use because we're

805
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,270
about to get the
transcript dump like in the

806
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,130
format that i showed
you and like you know

807
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,850
we can remove all the
time stamps and stuff

808
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,950
instead of move things
into place so there's

809
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:29,310
going to be another
layer of complexity but

810
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:32,730
I think having our own
words is is going to

811
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,730
be important wherever
we can sort of patch

812
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:38,230
them in and move
things around I tried

813
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,110
reorganizing some things
like Consuelo when you

814
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,610
had written a lot I
tried to move some things

815
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,830
together to where they
sort of seemed like

816
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:48,210
they were part of our
conversation last week

817
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,630
so I guess I'm kind
of looking to see

818
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,970
we needed a lot
from Felix and a lot

819
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,410
of what you just
said and Felix is

820
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,290
like so much more
developed than what

821
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,830
you said last week.
So I think it's

822
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:01,090
good we came back
and did this anyway.

823
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:06,370
What do you think, I
mean, part of the issue

824
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,790
here is like for a
little while it was just

825
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,590
sort of me and Felix
going back and forth.

826
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:11,750
So we might sort of
artificially patch

827
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:17,350
Consuelo in, but is
there a piece of this

828
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:20,590
where we should pick
up and continue,

829
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,410
like from the document?

830
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,750
What do we have?
What do we need?

831
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:32,030
I guess part of what
we just did was reframe

832
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,870
the questions a little
bit, add two new

833
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,490
questions. That's a
substantial, big change.

834
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:39,270
Felix was tossing out
source citations that

835
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:41,290
we need to put in. One
of them was Jeffrey

836
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:44,630
Rockwell's book on,
well, Jeffrey Rockwell

837
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:47,410
et al. on, was it
Voyance? And the idea of

838
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:50,570
having physical books as
resources and material

839
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:53,590
stuff was important.
the hermeneutica

840
00:42:54,630 --> 00:43:00,730
yes um yeah i think we
have to add also um we

841
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:03,030
discussed this uh
last week the other

842
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:06,810
question about like for
whom we're making the

843
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:09,350
project okay and we
talk about that i think

844
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:12,450
it's it's in here
actually it's when i was

845
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:15,130
was it captured i
mentioned at the beginning

846
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:18,510
of my introduction
kind of okay was that

847
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:21,230
captured or we should
or you can read was it

848
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:22,930
captured in the summary
or we should just

849
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:25,910
yes i think it is in
some ways it's not it's

850
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:28,950
good enough because yeah
we're realizing like

851
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:32,110
it lost examples
and details yes and

852
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:36,790
there's no bridge in the
end of this i know um

853
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:43,790
yeah i let me see it
does have a bridge but

854
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:49,180
it's not as good as our
bridge yeah i i think

855
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:00,150
this was like balancing
technical uh skills

856
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:02,150
and culture this is
when felix started

857
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:04,630
talking about like the
work in the archive

858
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:09,230
uh the work with the
materials uh in nigeria

859
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,230
that the person is
creating this archive and

860
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:16,210
going into and doing
this by memory and

861
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:19,350
going into the community
and build all the

862
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:21,290
materials with the community
and we were talking

863
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:23,670
about all these
things are like around

864
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:28,730
a digital printer
necessarily and then uh

865
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:31,860
yeah like projects in
multilingual environments

866
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:38,590
and we talked about
the yeah like lack of

867
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:41,890
electricity and stuff
too that yeah yeah

868
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:45,230
so it is on the balancing
technical skills

869
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:48,450
and culture kind of
point in the document um

870
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:54,610
so yeah it was like
we were like how we

871
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:56,990
there's like different
things like like

872
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:00,370
skills like i can't
remember i say like

873
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:03,170
we if we have like
we can have a project

874
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,230
with the best
programmer server but

875
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:07,430
and the best technology
but if we made

876
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:09,160
the whole project and
it's not available

877
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:14,090
right availability yeah
it happened with the

878
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:16,370
bamboo project when
they were like doing an

879
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:19,290
archive for it was it
was for a Caribbean

880
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:22,990
island it's Puerto Rico
or something or Dominica

881
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:26,790
and I'm trying to
remember they came to

882
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:30,290
do a talk in a class
on that and they made

883
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:33,250
all this archive and
when they get there their

884
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:35,410
internet weren't able
to download or to

885
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:39,290
show the images so it
was basically only to

886
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:41,670
show off outside the
community that it was

887
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:44,290
meant for I think it
was bamboo that had that

888
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:49,300
problem i cannot remember
very well um when

889
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:54,910
we when you were
discussing the rss feed and

890
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:59,450
how you came to um
kind of appreciate that

891
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,990
i wonder if you want to
say a little bit more

892
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:03,990
about like why that
was so helpful in the

893
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,050
context of podcasting
because like that's a

894
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:14,710
very yeah yeah yeah uh
okay let's well so so

895
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,450
actually like and having
just been listening

896
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:18,130
to felix like he was
talking about like

897
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:20,610
the importance of
getting people together

898
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:24,050
educating them and then
like bringing people into

899
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:26,250
contact with each
other like felix your

900
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,890
context was kind of
physically moving people

901
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:32,490
physically accessing
books like ripsy's digital

902
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:34,390
black atlantic which
we both realized we

903
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:36,310
have physical copies
of that we're really

904
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:39,050
happy that we have
because that's a matter of

905
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:41,750
access so you're not
sure if the digital is

906
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:45,350
going to be available
if you have a book you

907
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:47,230
can share it with
another human being in

908
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:49,930
your physical presence
but like what we do

909
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:52,310
with digital things um
when we're trying to

910
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:56,550
make them accessible when
we don't have we can't

911
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,450
be sure from year to
year if it's going

912
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:02,450
to be available things
like rss feeds really

913
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:06,890
matter yes yeah right
yeah they are amazing

914
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:09,830
i feel like i always
like go crazy on

915
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:12,490
the rss well i mean
it's just coming

916
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:14,550
back to that kids
just to get it back

917
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:18,380
down in the recording
yeah yeah podcasting

918
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:20,210
and audio it's like
the career that

919
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:23,820
i don't have that
i dream like my

920
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:28,170
sustain like my nine
to five kind of um

921
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:33,750
no i think uh rsss are
are amazing and it's

922
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,930
a great example of
a minimal computing

923
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:40,810
tool in a way that
they are very conscious

924
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:44,690
on the user point of
view like when you're

925
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:48,030
making a project
using errors files

926
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:52,360
there are there can be
shared on um software

927
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,790
like a catcher like
we call it a podcast

928
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,250
catcher audio catcher
you can hear in there

929
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,750
you can put it like
on your website uh

930
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:03,570
it's very easy doesn't
need like high internet

931
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,510
it was made in the
90s so it's thank you

932
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:10,290
for very very slow
equipment and even in

933
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:14,250
case that you don't have
anything like digital

934
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:17,030
like like a hardware
to hear it you could

935
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:22,470
use radio if you're
at those sources so i

936
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:26,270
know a couple of cases
on um there is like the

937
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:29,870
first podcast that
and i talk about this

938
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:32,410
and another chapter of
another book but there

939
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,750
is this first podcast
it's a mexican one

940
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:38,390
actually and it's from
the 90s it's like even

941
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,810
early that the first
thing we call podcast

942
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:42,950
but it's not on like
history books because

943
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:47,390
usually podcasting
and errors as files or

944
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:50,790
like the story of them
it's very it's still

945
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:54,710
into the anglophone
world it's only from the

946
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:56,550
first world perspective
and they forget

947
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:58,570
like all these tiny
things are happening and

948
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:00,350
this is very interesting
it's like it's been

949
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:04,010
forever this show it's
a news sarcastic kind

950
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:07,410
of show it's not an
academic one um but

951
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:10,450
the interesting thing
that they also use radio

952
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:14,550
for places they
could not get to like

953
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:17,050
someone would not get
like internet or like

954
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:19,850
permanent internet
electricity whatever they

955
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:23,410
have video so i feel
like this is a great

956
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:26,510
example of a tool and
projects that are like

957
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:30,430
100 thinking on who's
gonna hear how it's gonna

958
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:33,950
hear it where it's
gonna hear it um when

959
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:36,530
i was making my vodkas
i decided to make it

960
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:38,650
in spanish like there's
all least the reason

961
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:40,470
that i think i'm funny
i'm more intelligent

962
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:43,390
in spanish uh which
is like the little

963
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:49,270
joke that goes uh but
also um i was thinking

964
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:52,010
on and when when i
was like deciding the

965
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:54,190
language and deciding to
do it in spanish i was

966
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,590
thinking like in what
they are hearing are

967
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:58,750
they using their cell
phones do they have

968
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:03,870
mac products probably
not so much uh i feel

969
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:06,770
like uh the apple i
don't know if we will

970
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:10,440
name brands but the fruit
brand the apple brand

971
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,650
um it wasn't a big
thing it was really

972
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:17,070
hard to get it like
until like recent years

973
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:20,450
at least in chile like
and still like there's

974
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:24,070
a very heavy tax on
who have it or not have

975
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:28,390
it and and kind of a
money gatekeeping so

976
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,150
you have to think about
like who is hearing

977
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:34,530
where is hearing what
tools are using uh it's

978
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:38,710
gonna be radio or
not and that give you

979
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:44,890
that freedom and that
way of working with i'm

980
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:48,650
i feel i'm rumbling
around but um it's just

981
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:51,630
i get excited when i
think about this uh i

982
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:53,770
remember i have a
professor in high school

983
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:58,990
that he was teaching kids
from uh southern part

984
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:01,390
of chile that were
living in like uh

985
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:03,490
indigenous communities
that were like a bar so

986
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:05,170
they weren't able to
go to school every day

987
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:07,790
they were he was teaching
over radio how to

988
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:11,830
read to these kids they
will have this radio

989
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:13,830
program teaching how
to read and i was like

990
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:16,570
he had to travel every
time to the southern

991
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:19,390
to to near to the place
where this community

992
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:22,810
lives so he could do
the radio and as i grew

993
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:24,850
up and i started working
with podcasts and

994
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:28,370
and learning about uh
the rsss i was like

995
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:32,050
uh anybody could be
teaching those kids like

996
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:34,010
if you have someone
that could be able to

997
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:37,510
pick that feed and put
it on the radio signal

998
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:40,150
you could have everyone
in the world teaching

999
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:42,590
whatever is necessary
to escape not only

1000
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:45,040
how to read there is like
so many possibilities

1001
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,170
um and this is coming
back to what do

1002
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:51,790
we need to teach yes
and learn yeah yeah and

1003
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:55,150
and what matters the
most could make like

1004
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:57,470
like this teacher he was
a high school teacher

1005
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:01,010
this year who was
traveling every weekend

1006
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:03,270
and he was like taking
like night buses

1007
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:05,470
all night buses to get
to the place he did

1008
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:10,570
the radio program um it
might not be necessary

1009
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,650
like you will have so
many people you will

1010
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:14,390
have volunteers that
are like from the

1011
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:17,710
comfort of their home
teaching this kid a lot

1012
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:20,200
of skills that you
could teach by audio and

1013
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:23,210
and there are tools like
it's hard to imagine

1014
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:25,610
how to teach someone
how to read using

1015
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:29,250
the radio um but it's
possible and it's these

1016
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,170
cases show that it's
possible we are just

1017
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:32,950
not thinking of it
because we are not

1018
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:35,050
thinking outside the box
which minimal computer

1019
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:37,470
let us think outside
the box when we're

1020
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:39,870
making the the fourth
question and now the the

1021
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:42,870
new questions um and
i feel like it's like

1022
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:45,970
three questions like
what we did um the

1023
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:48,890
second one that that uh
you mentioned and what

1024
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:51,230
do we need to change
what we need to change

1025
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:54,410
and for who we're making
the project uh let

1026
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:57,870
us think outside the
box and and think on

1027
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:01,090
the material world
that it's around or

1028
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:04,670
hacking outside or coding
outside or softwares

1029
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:07,210
outside our
fancy equipment

1030
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:08,470
when we have women

1031
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:14,190
and yeah I feel
like and all of that

1032
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,330
was like

1033
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:18,610
part of

1034
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:21,810
when I started into
the documentaries

1035
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:23,330
when I started
seeing podcasting

1036
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:25,460
when I started
like seeing and I

1037
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,990
started like thinking
on okay this is

1038
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:30,470
all these things
are happening

1039
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:32,610
and kind of
click in my head

1040
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:39,990
yeah well okay

1041
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:44,310
this is great
so so i think

1042
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:46,310
we're we are
expanding on our

1043
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:48,590
conversation last
week quite a bit

1044
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,630
um let me see
what else do we

1045
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,270
should we try
to pick up here

1046
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:00,870
so I we could
come back so I'm

1047
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,010
looking at some of
the places where

1048
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:03,750
we have a lot
of bullet points

1049
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:10,630
and um that's where
we could come back I

1050
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:12,730
think it's in this area
toward like late in

1051
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:14,810
the conversation when
we were talking about

1052
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:18,490
the problems introduced
now things that

1053
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,170
are different now
than when we first had

1054
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:23,170
these conversations in
2022 and one of them

1055
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:26,090
of course is the
availability of ai and

1056
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:28,730
people telling us that
oh ai will be your

1057
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:31,110
teacher now and it's you
know maybe it's cheap

1058
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:34,650
and it's affordable
and um i think we have

1059
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:36,570
some maybe strong
feelings about that now

1060
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:43,830
um should we uh come
back to um to some

1061
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:47,610
of that i was talking
i remember about um

1062
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:53,910
the problems that I
mainly been reading about

1063
00:54:53,910 --> 00:55:00,410
where the big AI
companies harvesting

1064
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:03,550
textual without
accreditation and kind of

1065
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,290
pulling them into a black
box. They're applying

1066
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:08,770
very powerful natural
language processing

1067
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:11,570
tools that we are
not permitted to see.

1068
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:14,930
And at the same time,
like digesting that

1069
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:17,570
material and giving
it back to us um to

1070
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:23,670
consume and in conversation
and um that for

1071
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:27,350
many artists and
creators and writers and

1072
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:29,670
thinkers around the
world this is changing

1073
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:33,130
their livelihood it's
changing the basis

1074
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:36,390
of their work and for
us as digital humanities

1075
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:39,550
people it's raising
a question of the

1076
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:44,270
kinds of tools that
we want to use and um

1077
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:47,810
yeah like what what
do we do about it like

1078
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:50,810
you know to some
extent we rely on the

1079
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:53,690
things that big tech
gives us and in the

1080
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:57,750
minimal computing context
um perhaps there i

1081
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,730
mean one of the things
we talked about last

1082
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:03,290
week was well ease of
access is a priority

1083
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:06,610
that like if ai is
available maybe we

1084
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:09,750
want to use it to help
right help with things

1085
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,890
because it's the
easiest you don't have

1086
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:14,710
to it has a low barrier
of entry to have a

1087
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:16,630
conversation with a
chat bot and let it

1088
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:19,110
handle some of the
technical things for you

1089
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:23,830
um and then there's
the problem of yeah

1090
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:26,650
every time you're using
it it it's using you

1091
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:29,930
and your community and

1092
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:31,650
all of this. So, yeah.

1093
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:36,050
Yeah, I think it's
very important

1094
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:39,710
to talk about
post-2021, 2022,

1095
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:44,070
where this talk was
originally situated to

1096
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:47,030
the present time. I'm
thinking about it in

1097
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:51,130
two ways. One of it
is still the same

1098
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:54,770
system that we face in
the Global South where

1099
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:56,510
everything is shipped
down to the global

1100
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:59,270
south in terms of
technology infrastructure

1101
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:05,610
like the dh method dh
tools we hardly had

1102
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:07,350
any contribution
from the global south

1103
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:11,010
developing or contributing
a theory or concept

1104
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:14,930
or software or two
so the same embrace i

1105
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:19,050
call it warm embrace
that we had with the

1106
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:21,830
knowledge shipment
or knowledge transfer

1107
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:24,030
or knowledge mediation
in the global south

1108
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:27,830
from the west is still
the same lens. I'm

1109
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:31,670
thinking about the AI
in that space. It's

1110
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:34,510
still from the west,
if I should say that.

1111
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:39,570
So I think that will
be a way to, I mean,

1112
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:41,810
I'm thinking about it
if I have to put myself

1113
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:43,670
in the global south
right now on spot. So

1114
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:45,670
I think the first
would be how do I know

1115
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:50,490
how to use it to help
me navigate what coding

1116
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:54,350
I should do if I want
to learn DH and DH

1117
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:56,230
is saying I should learn
how to code the hack

1118
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:59,670
and yak and the debates
even in the West.

1119
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:03,310
So I think some of us
will quickly take it

1120
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:06,350
up and learn the tools
and use it to write

1121
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:10,050
CSS code or HTML code
without really knowing

1122
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:11,930
what the code is all
about. And if that

1123
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:13,850
works, then we can run
with it. So it's still

1124
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:15,610
the same method of we
want to learn the DH

1125
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:18,150
tools, DH method, even
though we don't have

1126
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:21,350
power or opportunity
to contribute to the

1127
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:24,590
development, but we
are the receiving hand.

1128
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:27,100
We want to use it.
So, and I think beyond

1129
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,210
the hype of AI, it's
still going to be the

1130
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:32,470
same systemic structure.
We want to use it

1131
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:35,210
to learn those things.
I remember reading

1132
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:40,880
Rebecca Rissam's iteration
or provocation about

1133
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,490
why she had to learn
coding, even though

1134
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:45,450
the debate has always
been you don't need

1135
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:47,710
to learn coding but she
when she was working

1136
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:51,050
on our post post
-colonial studies um the

1137
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:55,370
wb du bois projects she
needed a hands on some

1138
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:56,530
of those things that
they were building

1139
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:59,530
for her and she she
wanted to get control she

1140
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:01,550
wanted to contribute
to the building so

1141
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:06,350
she had to go learn java
not not just css java

1142
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:11,450
and she's way more
better for it now. I

1143
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:14,070
mean, over the years, of
course, the progression,

1144
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:16,130
it's not one year,
but over the years,

1145
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:17,890
so she can build
on her own. She can

1146
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:20,330
contribute to a project
where the technical team

1147
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:22,660
will be there. She could
say something about

1148
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,610
a project. So I think
that is the way-

1149
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:26,230
This is the surprising
position where the

1150
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:29,550
digital humanist stands
up to the know-it-all

1151
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:32,630
technician who has
the sort of supreme

1152
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:34,890
authority on how your
project is supposed to be

1153
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:38,510
made. and you say no
i see how your tool

1154
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:42,450
works here and i need
that to change yeah yeah

1155
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,470
and that's part of that
change conversation

1156
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:47,210
we were just having
right i think this is

1157
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:49,890
why it's important to
code is so that but

1158
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:54,690
when when somebody like
us and i i'm hoping

1159
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:56,990
is this in digital black
atlantic is is this

1160
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:58,950
one of her contributions
so she talks about

1161
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:01,970
this or just are
anything most recent

1162
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:05,550
chapter maybe 2026 or
2025 okay so this is very

1163
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:07,790
current stuff for her
yeah it looks like

1164
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:10,350
the way we are talking
about it so she also

1165
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:12,250
was like making that
kind of provocation

1166
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:14,990
movement so it's not
like you learn everything

1167
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:16,970
there is to know about
a programming language

1168
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:20,250
but you learn how it
affects your digital

1169
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:23,390
humanities project and
you become an expert

1170
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:26,510
on this area that
those those tech people

1171
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:28,570
have completely they
have blind spots

1172
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:31,170
they're not looking they
don't understand that

1173
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:33,870
tool is hurting people
here right or this

1174
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:36,450
yeah and i know you
said the same background

1175
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:38,490
if you were to share
with us you also have

1176
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:42,930
to do your primor tech
tech thing on your

1177
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,950
own i know you have
some insight to share

1178
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:48,430
before we move to a console
oh me about learning

1179
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:51,750
on my own so for me
on this and i probably

1180
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,670
did talk about this
in the ai summary

1181
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:58,430
would not pick it up so
for me i started doing

1182
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:01,470
digital humanities,
just I've been a

1183
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:04,410
traditional humanities
scholar. I was an English

1184
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:07,450
literature PhD, and
I work with Brit

1185
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:09,050
Lit. So I am
like kind of, my

1186
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:11,510
background is not very
Global South at all.

1187
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,670
But I just wanted
to go into the

1188
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:17,910
archives and help
make an edition of

1189
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:22,080
a 19th century woman
writer's letters and

1190
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,390
productions, like her
literary work. I just

1191
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:27,870
wanted to I wanted them
to be available and

1192
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:29,930
you know at first
there was a print book

1193
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:33,450
project but she wrote
so much and she's not

1194
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:36,750
canon so the big
publishing companies around

1195
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:39,990
2007 2008 weren't going
to produce that and

1196
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:43,690
that was with a big
scholar in my field like

1197
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:45,810
wanting to take on
that edition and I was

1198
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:48,650
just going to help so
I raised my hand at a

1199
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:50,250
conference and said
can I help with this

1200
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:52,670
project and he said i'm
sorry the publishing

1201
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:55,330
company has shut it down
and that's really how

1202
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:57,450
i began my journey
in digital humanities

1203
01:01:57,450 --> 01:02:00,390
was what and i was
learning there's these

1204
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:03,390
workshops on the tei
and there's workshops on

1205
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:06,030
like digitizing texts
and i found like oh

1206
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:08,870
there's a whole scholarly
method here and over

1207
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:11,750
the next few years
i got ****** into it

1208
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:16,070
and it felt like magic
oh i can And I can make

1209
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:20,130
a document data model
of my own that reflects

1210
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:22,990
where I want to see
her personal life

1211
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:25,950
writing in connection
with the plays that she's

1212
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,870
producing, which are
very kind of artificial,

1213
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,670
very structured and
formal. And then

1214
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:32,590
she's got these other
literary genres. Wait,

1215
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:34,570
I'm going to need help.
We need other people

1216
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:37,090
to help. I can't do
this alone was another

1217
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:39,130
lesson. And like, what
do I need? What do

1218
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:43,170
I want? It was 2013
-ish, 2014, when I got

1219
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:45,170
started. And I don't
know if we were using the

1220
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:48,550
phrase minimal computing
then, but where

1221
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:52,950
I'm situated, I'm at
regional university

1222
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:56,030
campuses. I was never
at like a research hub,

1223
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:58,310
but I always had like
interesting little

1224
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:00,570
projects and it's sort
of like, you know, but I

1225
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:04,530
didn't have to worry
so much as maybe others

1226
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:07,730
do. in maybe the
research r1 context where

1227
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:10,630
i was situated in the
regional campuses if

1228
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:13,030
you do something digital
and you can bring

1229
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:16,270
students with you
everybody's very excited

1230
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:18,790
because your little
campus now has something

1231
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:21,010
to say and something
to build with it and

1232
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:23,750
some things might be
more possible in that

1233
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:26,650
sort of regional
comprehensive context which

1234
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:30,150
is more about education
primarily and where

1235
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:33,430
nobody's expecting you
to do like the best

1236
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:35,990
research or the fastest
research or producing

1237
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:39,410
the most books. So I
got to have a little

1238
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:42,560
adventure with my life
as an academic because

1239
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,690
I'm, you know, a
little bit off center.

1240
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:47,970
And my experience
of minimal

1241
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:49,590
competing was simply,

1242
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:54,670
oh don't rely on tech
support don't rely

1243
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:57,270
on regular funding
what are the tools that

1244
01:03:57,270 --> 01:04:00,430
you can use that
don't cost and so that

1245
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:03,670
leads to things like
code repositories on

1246
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:06,950
github possibly
codeberg now if that's

1247
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:10,110
strong enough right or
like learning git and

1248
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:12,410
version control on
your own that's a huge

1249
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:14,490
lift oh that means
i have to learn

1250
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:18,330
command line just enough
yeah um I can make a

1251
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:21,010
little shell script
sometimes with help,

1252
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:23,590
right? But I'm not a
computer scientist.

1253
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:28,330
I can teach
students how I think

1254
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:30,970
about modeling
documents with code

1255
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:33,190
and get them doing
the same things.

1256
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:36,790
And it was kind of
an adventure of,

1257
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:39,730
oh, learning to
code meant learning.

1258
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,670
It meant that, oh, I
can do these things

1259
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:46,910
low cost or no cost.
It wasn't like if I do

1260
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:49,630
no code, I'm going to
have to contend with

1261
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:52,570
broken plugins and
people I can't rely on.

1262
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:54,810
Right. And it's kind
of that simple. But

1263
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:57,050
it's it's even more than
that. I mean, the code

1264
01:04:57,050 --> 01:05:02,650
gives me creative
license or it gives me

1265
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:05,010
and us like an opportunity
to build some of

1266
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:07,910
our own tools and
share them with others.

1267
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:10,230
And for me, that that's
a potential energy

1268
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:13,750
that's more exciting
than just studying

1269
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:16,790
literature and writing
about it. so like when I

1270
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:19,070
say oh digital humanities
it changed my life

1271
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:22,250
it did it's more
exciting now uh but yeah

1272
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:24,410
like my minimal context
is it's exciting

1273
01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:26,930
because I'm pinched
like I don't have access

1274
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:29,130
that other people do so
I guess that's that's

1275
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:33,210
my simple yeah how
does like the AI affect

1276
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:36,830
how does AI affect
that like how have you

1277
01:05:36,830 --> 01:05:38,590
seen it because like
you have this the

1278
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:44,490
students coining and also
like like it's tempting

1279
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:46,370
like sometimes you
have a you're like

1280
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:49,370
spending hours and you're
having like one error

1281
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:51,850
in one line and you
cannot see it and

1282
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:55,570
you're like oh my god
and you know there is you

1283
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:58,450
know there is a an ai
available that could

1284
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:01,210
give you something in
five seconds and so

1285
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:03,930
i do like i think
that's okay like like to

1286
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:07,290
use it as a friend to
your code like But then

1287
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:10,210
it's kind of a question
where, you know,

1288
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:13,550
and I've had these
weird relationships with

1289
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:17,050
AI over the past year
because everyone around

1290
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:19,110
me, of course, is
saying you should use

1291
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:21,450
AI, right? And you
should tell us all about

1292
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:23,570
it. It's important for
the university that

1293
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:25,730
you show you're using
AI. It's like, okay.

1294
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:30,570
So definitely using it
to help locate syntax

1295
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:33,670
errors. We would do
syntax validation in

1296
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:36,150
a good code editor,
too. Like I, you know,

1297
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:39,270
it's like one does not
handwrite code, right?

1298
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:45,830
But then you start
like to notice your AI

1299
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:48,790
bot has an assumption
about your code. And

1300
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:51,670
if you start asking it
bigger questions like,

1301
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:55,050
okay, I want to make
this data structure

1302
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,230
or I want to make a data
structure and I want

1303
01:06:57,230 --> 01:07:00,090
you to figure it out
for me. that's where

1304
01:07:00,090 --> 01:07:05,220
you start to lose the
lose the creative magic

1305
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:07,670
it's more exciting
to use ai when you're

1306
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:10,690
like oh no no no i
really want this and you

1307
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:13,270
have to help me because
i'm stuck here right

1308
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:15,630
that's one thing but
the other side of it

1309
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:18,470
is i don't know what
to do um can you help

1310
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:21,410
and then i get the same
kind of glossy stuff

1311
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:24,650
or even it'll give
me back something i

1312
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:26,590
don't want and then
have a fight with it but

1313
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:30,450
then at some point i
start losing time so i

1314
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:34,150
think it it starts
******* my time and energy

1315
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,990
and changing my way
of thinking and and

1316
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:39,030
for that reason sort
of pulling away back to

1317
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:41,690
the material world
might be good like maybe

1318
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:44,470
i want to sit down
with pen and paper and

1319
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:47,290
like mark my tax and
figure out what what do

1320
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:51,370
i want and you know
go from there um i i

1321
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:54,090
don't have a good
answer for this, but the

1322
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:59,030
place I'm moving with
AI right now is to try

1323
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:03,170
to minimize it. So that
is relevant where I

1324
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:06,110
have a little research
project right now that

1325
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:08,290
I'm going to be talking
about, or I have

1326
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:10,650
started talking about
it at conferences. My

1327
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:13,030
students want to learn
about AI and I want

1328
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:16,230
to find a responsible
way of working with it.

1329
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:19,790
With a very big old
project like mine at

1330
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:22,750
the Digital Mitford.
People come and go. We've

1331
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,910
had generations of
students come and go.

1332
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:27,070
There's a lot of
unevenness, a lot of

1333
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:29,910
unfinished work, and it
gets put aside for more

1334
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:32,470
glamorous projects like
my Frankenstein project

1335
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:35,430
and other things or
even this AI thing.

1336
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:38,710
And what it would be
nice is to have an AI

1337
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:43,610
humbly learn from our
project standards, give

1338
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:47,790
it like a local customized
AI that understands

1339
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,890
what we need to do
and take some of the

1340
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:53,970
heavy labor and speed
that up for us what

1341
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:56,670
because we're clear on
what we want and what

1342
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:59,510
we need to finish now
my dream here is to

1343
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:03,250
have this run totally
on a desktop computer so

1344
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:06,290
it doesn't need a data
center and that it

1345
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:09,070
also runs on things that
the code that i know

1346
01:09:09,070 --> 01:09:12,310
how to write like i
can write a schema i

1347
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:14,850
can write some x path
i can say these are the

1348
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:17,210
relationships we're
trying to build here's

1349
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:19,790
some unfinished code
help me finish it and

1350
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:22,270
you know the other side
of ai in where i work

1351
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:24,390
with digital scholarly
editions is the

1352
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:27,350
really powerful stuff that
says here's handwriting

1353
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:30,050
up and down the sides
of a page backwards

1354
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:33,870
upside down sideways
can you help with the

1355
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:36,110
starter transcription
of that like there's

1356
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:39,730
some amazing but that's
also very customized

1357
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:42,370
and the sort of thing
that humanity scholars

1358
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:44,810
you don't just go cold
to a chatbot to do

1359
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:47,130
that you've built
that little engine and

1360
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:50,970
it's hard work to make
it right so i think like

1361
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:52,810
the place but is is
this sort of like the

1362
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:55,990
hard rewarding labor
of customizing a thing

1363
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:58,690
so that you change
it for your specific

1364
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:01,610
project i guess yeah
that's where that's where

1365
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:06,030
i am with it i i get
it with with ai i see

1366
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:10,130
the same as felix i
feel like it's very done

1367
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:13,970
in the global north kind
of it's very centered

1368
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:16,210
on their necessities
it's very centered

1369
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:19,730
in their material like
i remember like early

1370
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:22,730
chat gpt like like
getting information in

1371
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:24,790
spanish i like to
experiment with it every

1372
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:27,230
now and then i will ask
questions or like you

1373
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:30,010
know like news or stuff
like that to see how

1374
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:31,810
it's like picking up
information in other

1375
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:34,330
languages in my cases
i take it in spanish

1376
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:41,370
which is my native
language um and so uh i i

1377
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:44,130
check that up because
i kind of worry in a

1378
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:47,010
way that all the
information and all the

1379
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:49,410
feedback it's like it
could be in spanish but

1380
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:51,450
it could be just
translated and not be like

1381
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:55,150
like originally coming
from from this point

1382
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:58,030
of view and i feel like
that it's like something

1383
01:10:58,030 --> 01:11:00,330
that it's like a
little bit tricky but

1384
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:03,690
then again with coding
like i i think discusses

1385
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:06,810
like i i wrote it
down in there in the

1386
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:09,810
document uh but something
interesting about

1387
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:12,990
coding coding believes
that english is the

1388
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:18,050
lingua franca and it is
not that's its foundation

1389
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:21,090
and that is foundation
so you need a base

1390
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:24,150
in english to be able
to construct and to

1391
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:27,330
able to think because
you're when you start

1392
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:29,030
programming you're
basically thinking in

1393
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:32,870
three different languages
one that it's like

1394
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:35,870
the logic of this language
is not made coding

1395
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:37,570
then you have to learn
the language that

1396
01:11:37,570 --> 01:11:39,890
the logic is working
with and then you have to

1397
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:44,470
code so there are like
so many steps missing

1398
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:47,590
in in in that i like
i remember my first

1399
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:50,930
coding classes were in
2022 because i I jump

1400
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:53,250
from like podcasting
and like more simple

1401
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:56,290
things and then I jump
into like oh now I need

1402
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:58,770
to record code and
I remember like the

1403
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:00,910
first weeks of like
learning I was learning

1404
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:03,190
Java I was learning
like something difficult

1405
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:07,410
in general and I
remember having struggles

1406
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:09,790
like thinking sometimes
in commands because I

1407
01:12:09,790 --> 01:12:11,510
will think the name
in Spanish and then I

1408
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:13,830
translate it but I don't
translate it in the

1409
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:16,890
one that is used for
coding so I will use

1410
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:21,130
another signer and I
will why is red why the

1411
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:23,430
the dot is not moving
from one corner to the

1412
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:25,910
other one and i
couldn't understand like

1413
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:32,560
doing like like movements
like that and so ai

1414
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:35,510
can be helpful in that
way for someone that

1415
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:38,210
doesn't know a big base
in english and wants

1416
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:40,510
to do their own project
and it's like where

1417
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:43,250
do i start and how do
i start but i think

1418
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:46,330
we need different ai
tools than the ones we're

1419
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:48,970
given right even the
ones were given for

1420
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:52,690
free even right yeah
then is it for free like

1421
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:54,950
you yeah no it's not
really it's an addiction

1422
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:57,210
it's an addiction
model right you get

1423
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:59,970
more and more dependent
yeah and then they they

1424
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:03,350
ask you for money to
get more of something

1425
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:07,890
that you are feeding
so so basically you

1426
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:10,330
own stuff that you're
giving it but also you

1427
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:13,030
have to pay to get the
feedback of the things

1428
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:15,510
that you own and you're
giving to the AI.

1429
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:19,950
Yeah, I think we should
step back a second

1430
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:21,970
here and also recognize
this is something

1431
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:24,830
the TEI community has
been having discussions

1432
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:28,410
about internationalization
and where

1433
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:31,230
there's a portion there
are members of our

1434
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:35,250
community like Till
Growler and like others.

1435
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:38,290
Like it's a small group
that they're digitizing

1436
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:43,110
um like newspapers
periodicals printed

1437
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:46,450
in arabic but printing
in arabic if this

1438
01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:49,770
goes back pre-computer
that's like a right to

1439
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:51,990
left ligature language
and the printing

1440
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:54,870
machines never got it
right in the way that

1441
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:58,210
it was sort of locally
expressed and our

1442
01:13:58,210 --> 01:14:01,910
computer code systems
are built like the text

1443
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:04,910
encoding like the
encoding of characters

1444
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:08,530
character encoding like
ascii and unicode was

1445
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:13,650
always like never
appropriate for that kind

1446
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:15,790
of language structure
and so like when the

1447
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:19,350
whole machinery is
wrong and yet you can

1448
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:21,650
still archive and code
because the machinery

1449
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:24,210
that produced the
text was readable it's

1450
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:26,930
like you're looking at
this history of machinery

1451
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:30,130
in a state of
cultural compromise um

1452
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:32,530
and it's kind of
fascinating like to listen

1453
01:14:32,530 --> 01:14:36,630
to um like somebody
like Till talk about um

1454
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:40,150
you know like what that
means and like what

1455
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:42,030
kinds of projects
they're able to make out

1456
01:14:42,030 --> 01:14:44,450
of it and you know
and like what what do

1457
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:47,210
we do how do we change
the tools these are

1458
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:49,570
huge questions that
don't have answers but

1459
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:52,950
what do we need to change
starts like getting

1460
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:55,030
a getting to be bigger
and bigger now maybe

1461
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:59,370
in the mid 2020s then
you know can i jump

1462
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:02,750
in and connect this
um important thing you

1463
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:06,750
just raised about the
history of the machines

1464
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:08,810
that produce the
scholarly traditions.

1465
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:10,790
I kind of have this kind

1466
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:13,110
of trace model
in my mind,

1467
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:16,010
which is a critical
way to think about it.

1468
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:18,650
From the global north,

1469
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:20,470
the debate,

1470
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:22,450
or the trends,

1471
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:26,450
or the shifts from one
form of scholarship

1472
01:15:26,450 --> 01:15:28,690
within the DH to
another form, to another

1473
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:32,290
form. I'll make it more
simple. It was usually

1474
01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:35,330
called the digital
edition. We want to make

1475
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:38,290
sure the Emily Dickinson
archive is online.

1476
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:39,470
Yeah.

1477
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:42,950
Now, it's into
digitization. We want to

1478
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:46,470
ensure all newspapers
are digitized from

1479
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:48,490
microfilm, which is
different from solid edition,

1480
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:50,550
from microfilm to
all the dissertation

1481
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:53,610
pipelines so that machine
learning algorithm

1482
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:56,270
can access them for
textual analysis.

1483
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:59,730
That's another paradigm.
and now we have the

1484
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:02,570
paradigm of using the
ai cloud to really

1485
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:05,470
help you to do the
coding as well as do the

1486
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:07,970
building of the technical
skills and as well

1487
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:11,470
as building the
projects where are we in

1488
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:13,490
the global south in
all these paradigm

1489
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:17,130
shifts we really started
digitizing like you

1490
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:19,370
mentioned if we go back
to national archives

1491
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:23,900
in nigeria are they
really scanned let

1492
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:29,070
alone digitized into
um vectors or what

1493
01:16:29,070 --> 01:16:32,870
abeddings that can be
used to train anything so

1494
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:36,810
i'm kind of thinking
i don't know where we

1495
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:41,040
are right yeah and
the global notes moved

1496
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:45,410
over a decade i can
track it this is 2026

1497
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:46,910
2016,

1498
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:48,970
the goal would be
scholarly tradition,

1499
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:57,450
so I'm not thinking
that we're now in 2026,

1500
01:16:57,450 --> 01:17:00,330
that that's what Global
North is doing with

1501
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:02,930
the age, especially
when it's branching out

1502
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:05,010
to sub-disciplines like
cultural analytics,

1503
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:06,650
computational humanities,

1504
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:08,950
everybody's talking,
they start reading.

1505
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:10,890
Are we there?

1506
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:13,670
Where is the landscape

1507
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:17,350
of the global south
dh i mean from the

1508
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:19,530
typical example you
gave on the arabic so we

1509
01:17:19,530 --> 01:17:22,130
still have that kind
of challenge back in

1510
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:24,210
other global south
countries in india and

1511
01:17:24,210 --> 01:17:27,110
the rest where is the
landscape even within

1512
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:30,010
the minimal computing
concentration yeah

1513
01:17:30,010 --> 01:17:31,610
that's a good question
i want us to think

1514
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:34,170
about connecting with
what matters to do in

1515
01:17:34,170 --> 01:17:37,070
the global south now
yeah yeah i know that

1516
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:41,790
i feel yeah it's i i
hate to use this word

1517
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:44,490
i hate to use a slow i
think it's our stages

1518
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:47,730
but also i feel stages
are like it's not

1519
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:49,690
something that it's about
level it's something

1520
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:52,630
that it's about the
not media or just it's

1521
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:55,470
not linear uh so i
don't like to put like

1522
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:58,530
like this global south
is behind the global

1523
01:17:58,530 --> 01:18:00,850
south is dealing with
other problems right

1524
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:03,450
so that's why we're
taking more time in

1525
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:07,470
different things um it's
it's complicated when

1526
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:10,230
when you're trying to
put it uh versus high

1527
01:18:10,230 --> 01:18:12,750
to emoji again like
minimal computer let

1528
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:16,630
us to think about
digital projects digital

1529
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:19,670
necessities not on a
scale of how advanced

1530
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:22,210
we are correct we're
on the scales of the

1531
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:26,450
necessities which i i
really love that um but

1532
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:30,290
i think like like
what is happening i've

1533
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:32,590
been seeing in chile
for example there's been

1534
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:36,210
a wave of a lot of uh
programming like there

1535
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:40,330
is an r group of
programming in chile like

1536
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:43,450
sort ladies or our
ladies in chile get

1537
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:45,550
together there's also
like it's a linkedin for

1538
01:18:45,550 --> 01:18:48,290
the group i'm in the
group i never i i

1539
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:50,650
haven't been able to jump
into one because like

1540
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:52,990
the three hour difference
is a killer when

1541
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:56,250
you're trying to get
time to to get it but

1542
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:58,810
i've seen like there
are like so many new

1543
01:18:58,810 --> 01:19:02,470
initiatives on like
learning how to go learning

1544
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:05,790
tools um i cannot
remember now but there

1545
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:09,750
is a woman a professor
in is it in stanford

1546
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:13,890
she now has a group
for the age in spanish

1547
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:16,940
she collects people
that want to teach

1548
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:19,610
different tools so
she's teaching omegas in

1549
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:22,970
spanish she's teaching
like buoyant in spanish

1550
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:25,210
she's teaching different
things and like

1551
01:19:25,210 --> 01:19:28,030
she's inviting and she's
doing it out of her

1552
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:32,750
heart kind of um and
and it's a whole group

1553
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:34,510
and they have like
this seminar and it's

1554
01:19:34,510 --> 01:19:37,170
called like like like
the like humanities in

1555
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:40,390
for like spanish
speakers and it's like

1556
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:43,970
all those those efforts
that are are coming

1557
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:46,950
into and i feel like
the translation of tools

1558
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:49,070
it's something very
necessarily and tools

1559
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:51,770
are like no the fanciest
tools are like the

1560
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:55,630
ones that cover the
necessities and like

1561
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:58,910
let us like play with
it and advance with it

1562
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:03,070
and also control it so
i mean that connects

1563
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:04,670
to something felix
and i were talking

1564
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:06,730
about with like ant
conch and voyant being

1565
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:09,290
like so quickly
accessible and you can

1566
01:20:09,290 --> 01:20:11,870
see so much and you
can get in and change

1567
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:14,850
the tool and yeah yeah
yeah so that sounds

1568
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:17,130
like another yet
another example of us

1569
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:21,650
yes oh you have like
also like the and i

1570
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,980
have to put it here
programming historian

1571
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:27,850
they have like they have
even like portuguese

1572
01:20:27,850 --> 01:20:30,730
they have they have
so many with like

1573
01:20:30,730 --> 01:20:34,710
even french uh spanish
so you have like all

1574
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:40,130
these uh tutorials so
i feel like the kind of

1575
01:20:40,130 --> 01:20:43,810
the moment that we are
sitting in it's like

1576
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:49,390
taking control over
our tools taking

1577
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:51,590
control over what is
happening i think that is

1578
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:54,090
job in the global south
how we take control

1579
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:58,070
how we reclaim all
of these and make it

1580
01:20:58,070 --> 01:21:01,390
ours or how we reclaim
the basics so we could

1581
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:04,590
make our own projects
under our own logic

1582
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:08,470
um i love what you just
said making our own

1583
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:11,510
projects under our own
logic like we should

1584
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:14,940
like put a big it's
really good yeah but

1585
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:19,610
yes i i remember
reading on um this is on

1586
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:24,430
design like humanities
and design and ux designer

1587
01:21:24,430 --> 01:21:28,030
i cannot remember i
read this for this

1588
01:21:28,030 --> 01:21:32,530
design class um on
african-american digital

1589
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:36,050
design and how the
websites and how like

1590
01:21:36,050 --> 01:21:38,110
everything looks
different than the white

1591
01:21:38,110 --> 01:21:42,150
green background but
the powerful color and

1592
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:45,210
imagery and and even
though it's not that the

1593
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:48,950
tendency it's not like
the polish look that

1594
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:52,410
it's imposed to us
to make and to create

1595
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:56,190
designing for like
the community take it

1596
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:58,250
taking the tools and
making your own taking

1597
01:21:58,250 --> 01:22:00,550
the the possibility of
like creating a website

1598
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:03,830
and making your own
i feel like that it's

1599
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:06,710
it's something and
make it available in

1600
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:08,770
your own language i
think i think of my

1601
01:22:08,770 --> 01:22:11,210
parents like they don't
speak they miss so many

1602
01:22:11,210 --> 01:22:14,710
stuff kind of and
they were also missing

1603
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:18,090
them like kind of kind
of that it's like the

1604
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:21,050
feeling like they miss
hearing like my mom

1605
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:23,150
and my dad saying
like intelligent stuff

1606
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:25,950
not only intelligent
but like having like

1607
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:28,590
everything they know
and they also miss so

1608
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:30,530
much information that
it's available and

1609
01:22:30,530 --> 01:22:32,510
accessible for so
many people but only

1610
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:35,590
because they don't fit
on what these tools

1611
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:38,190
and what this information
is made of yeah i

1612
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:39,920
get a little bit
emotional on that sorry

1613
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:43,010
no that's actually i
think that's the the

1614
01:22:43,010 --> 01:22:45,350
stuff that makes us
emotional is what matters

1615
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:49,050
to say here now
yeah yeah and i feel

1616
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:53,250
like like uh minimal
computer let us i can't

1617
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:55,790
let us think us about
outside the box let

1618
01:22:55,790 --> 01:22:59,390
us build something
robust build a bridge

1619
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:05,250
yeah build a bridge
build a bridge yeah

1620
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:08,050
so about that bridge
building i think

1621
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:11,250
the ai summary got
this just didn't

1622
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:13,670
get it like so so
let's get it again

1623
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:15,690
what are you talking
about with that

1624
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:21,090
but uh i feel like we
we jump into that like

1625
01:23:21,090 --> 01:23:22,770
in different moments
when we were talking

1626
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:26,070
about DH practitioner
in general like so

1627
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:31,470
builders bridge builders
um when we were taking

1628
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:33,650
like the big cameras
i'm like she's talking

1629
01:23:33,650 --> 01:23:35,490
about like the project
that i was talking

1630
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:38,720
like she's able to now
navigate two worlds

1631
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:41,990
she's able to talk to
the tech guy and then

1632
01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:45,210
talk to the one who
is doing the maybe the

1633
01:23:45,210 --> 01:23:47,870
cultural interpretation or
the cultural necessities

1634
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:51,630
for a project and
that is a huge example

1635
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:54,830
of what what we do
as digital humanities

1636
01:23:54,830 --> 01:23:57,630
practitioners we are
in the middle of two

1637
01:23:57,630 --> 01:23:59,410
worlds we're in the
middle of the physical and

1638
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:01,210
digital like even
while we were talking

1639
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:04,450
about like the books and
having physical books

1640
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:07,190
and and work with
physical materials and you

1641
01:24:07,190 --> 01:24:08,890
have theater projects
are like they need

1642
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:12,430
so much physical work
because everything is

1643
01:24:12,430 --> 01:24:15,230
not online everything
is not like there and

1644
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:18,190
you have to build from
that so it's like it's

1645
01:24:18,370 --> 01:24:22,230
like this this stress
hole that we are like

1646
01:24:22,230 --> 01:24:27,270
sitting in uh and i i
enjoy that and i think

1647
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:29,410
like like minimal
computer it is like

1648
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:33,270
thinking on how we create
a base how we create

1649
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:36,550
a base for a project
how we think about all

1650
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:38,450
that we need how we
get to the other side

1651
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:41,450
all together and and
recognize every piece

1652
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:44,230
that it made that possible
but i want to jump

1653
01:24:44,230 --> 01:24:46,570
on what do you think
about this bridge idea

1654
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:50,550
so i mean it as we've
been talking this

1655
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:53,130
morning i feel like a
thing that emerged for

1656
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:56,450
me much more clearly
now is the physical

1657
01:24:56,450 --> 01:24:59,610
groundwork that that
foundation of our

1658
01:24:59,610 --> 01:25:03,670
bridge is the world we
physically live in and

1659
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:06,010
the worlds we move
through when we travel

1660
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:08,230
and like you know
where our communities

1661
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:12,710
are living and what
they can access what do

1662
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:14,650
they have what do
they want what do they

1663
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:20,970
need um that as we're
trying to find the

1664
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:24,770
right things to teach
that knowing where

1665
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:26,610
they are even if we're
going to teach them

1666
01:25:26,610 --> 01:25:28,870
in an online context
how will they access

1667
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:31,790
us right how will they
reach for us is there

1668
01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:34,790
something they can
download that's not

1669
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:38,270
enormous that like but
that's also something

1670
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:40,630
they can pick up
and find interesting

1671
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:44,690
and um connects with
things they care about

1672
01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:49,370
um yeah it's like meeting
in that like being

1673
01:25:49,370 --> 01:25:51,750
aware of the physical
groundwork and its

1674
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:55,970
limits and yeah seems
seems very important

1675
01:25:58,950 --> 01:26:03,410
what do you think
about this bridge do

1676
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:05,580
you see yourself
as a bridge builder

1677
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:10,910
i see a bridge behind
you yeah yeah i

1678
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:12,250
think in the context
of the global

1679
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:17,210
south dh has been a
bridge i i i made a

1680
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:20,690
connection before i mean
earlier this morning

1681
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:24,490
we're with elisa that
the kind of training

1682
01:26:24,490 --> 01:26:28,090
education in the
community um serve as

1683
01:26:28,090 --> 01:26:30,950
a bridge for a couple
of us to gain access

1684
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:35,010
to um global north
education in in grad

1685
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:39,710
programs a lot of us
moved in through primarily

1686
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:41,710
the training we got
from summer schools

1687
01:26:41,710 --> 01:26:45,350
and conferences in
nigeria that stimulates

1688
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:48,770
our interest we we now
when we write sop i

1689
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:52,150
can mention buoyant
not to the degree of

1690
01:26:52,150 --> 01:26:54,590
how much i can use it
but i can mention it

1691
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:57,970
in my sop and and that
that kind of moved

1692
01:26:57,970 --> 01:27:01,640
me into loyola um in in
that kind of foundation

1693
01:27:01,690 --> 01:27:03,810
i already have with
summer school and

1694
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:06,790
conferences. So I think
DH serves as a bridge

1695
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:09,190
in that sense of human
capacity development

1696
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:11,670
and kind of transfer
of knowledge from

1697
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:13,770
global south to global
north. The second

1698
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:18,110
thing why DH serves as
a bridge is I'm strongly

1699
01:27:18,110 --> 01:27:20,210
believing that it's
maybe not in the

1700
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:22,170
full scale but in the
scale of connecting to

1701
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:25,390
the community that
hones the data, that

1702
01:27:25,390 --> 01:27:27,730
hones the manuscript
that hones the history.

1703
01:27:27,970 --> 01:27:31,890
So DH would normally
serve as a bridge for

1704
01:27:31,890 --> 01:27:34,650
DH practitioners to now
work with the community.

1705
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:36,810
Like we mentioned
last week, the Muktu

1706
01:27:36,810 --> 01:27:40,210
software was built on
the basis of how the

1707
01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:44,270
community see the
history and the tool was

1708
01:27:44,270 --> 01:27:46,660
built on that. So it
wasn't like off-the-shelf

1709
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:50,250
tool that was implanted
into a community

1710
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:52,070
of users. It was a
community of users that

1711
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:54,370
built it and the
purpose was to allow the

1712
01:27:54,370 --> 01:27:57,190
community with the DH
practitioners as well as

1713
01:27:57,190 --> 01:27:59,950
the community to work
together and build

1714
01:27:59,950 --> 01:28:03,670
digital objects or
digital artifacts through

1715
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:05,950
that too. So I'm thinking
that would be on the

1716
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:08,150
educational access
of educating either

1717
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:11,650
within an outside country
or where the DH is

1718
01:28:11,650 --> 01:28:14,510
located. The other one is
the access to connecting

1719
01:28:14,510 --> 01:28:16,430
the community with
the DH practitioners

1720
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:18,770
as well as the, which
might still be a long

1721
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:21,870
way coming because
Because like I mentioned,

1722
01:28:21,870 --> 01:28:24,390
the Texas projects
of massacre in Texas,

1723
01:28:24,490 --> 01:28:28,570
where the Professor
Amy was able to work

1724
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:32,210
closely with the lived
experiences of people

1725
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:34,750
who, one way or the
other, witnessed the

1726
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:37,830
massacre or they could
give a history about it.

1727
01:28:37,830 --> 01:28:40,450
And she wasn't
building a project as a

1728
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:43,290
professor from the office.
She built the project

1729
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:46,370
with the community
that the massacre took

1730
01:28:46,370 --> 01:28:48,970
place. how much of
that we have in global

1731
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:51,030
south would be a question
but i think that is

1732
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:53,710
what i mean by bridge
that's the way i see

1733
01:28:53,710 --> 01:28:56,050
it that we now begin
to engage the community

1734
01:28:56,050 --> 01:28:59,090
of people who hones
the project i mean

1735
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:02,020
who hones the history
we want to preserve uh

1736
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:06,750
we we tell them the
story um we tell them

1737
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:09,170
the technical skills
that we can use and we

1738
01:29:09,170 --> 01:29:12,030
allow them to contribute
to also open up to

1739
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:14,470
say or we can contribute
the third bridge

1740
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:18,490
would be going forward
i mean would be the dh

1741
01:29:18,490 --> 01:29:20,150
practitioners from
the global south also

1742
01:29:20,150 --> 01:29:22,890
contributing to tech
developments that's

1743
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:26,190
another bridge i'm
thinking about um which in

1744
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:30,430
in the first decade
or so what we do is to

1745
01:29:30,430 --> 01:29:33,790
use the tools and
being able to see the

1746
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:38,210
limitation or the strength
but not amenable or

1747
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:41,550
applicable to our own
data set so the question

1748
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:44,170
will not be DH
practitioners in the global

1749
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:48,430
south also contributing
to enough tech

1750
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:51,630
development or existing
changes in existing

1751
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:54,530
tech developments that
are all undergoing. A

1752
01:29:54,530 --> 01:29:58,050
case study would be a
PhD candidate in UK,

1753
01:29:58,350 --> 01:30:02,270
Augustine Fariola,
was very instrumental

1754
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,950
back then in Nigeria.
He had philosophy

1755
01:30:04,950 --> 01:30:08,970
background so his
epistemology mentor skill set

1756
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:13,290
was profound so he
was able to get his

1757
01:30:13,290 --> 01:30:16,130
training in nigeria move
to the uk for phd now

1758
01:30:16,130 --> 01:30:19,350
he works with rockwell
in canada um building

1759
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:22,550
the voyance tools
consortium which is uh

1760
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:26,780
another body beyond
the two developers but

1761
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:30,090
contributors who had
used the tool for

1762
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:32,810
researches and they
want to say this is what

1763
01:30:32,810 --> 01:30:35,430
will find out and so
he's the one anchoring

1764
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:37,280
that because he has a
background in philosophy

1765
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:40,830
he has a training in
DH and he's on his

1766
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:42,870
PhD program so he
was able to work with

1767
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:45,530
Rockwell Jeffrey Rockwell
building the community

1768
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:48,450
side of it beyond
the two and getting

1769
01:30:48,450 --> 01:30:51,670
feedback so he runs
monthly or quarterly

1770
01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:56,630
workshop on DH on on
voyants I mean for all

1771
01:30:56,630 --> 01:30:59,790
week with Rockwell
for the global south.

1772
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:02,270
Nigerians, Cameroonians,
so they come together

1773
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:05,150
and the end goal of
such project was you

1774
01:31:05,150 --> 01:31:08,710
have to do a project
with voyants and you have

1775
01:31:08,710 --> 01:31:11,250
to tell us what you
did and tell us how

1776
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:13,910
to improve it. And so
that is his own goal.

1777
01:31:14,330 --> 01:31:17,530
Another case study I
would refer to is Yaku

1778
01:31:17,530 --> 01:31:21,010
James from University
of Kansas at Lawrence

1779
01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:26,470
building African DH.
He runs a symposium in

1780
01:31:26,470 --> 01:31:30,310
Ghana. Last year Alex
was there um and a

1781
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:32,250
couple of people would
always travel down to

1782
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:35,550
ghana to do african dh
now african dh in the

1783
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:38,570
in in the african
soil uh even though it

1784
01:31:38,570 --> 01:31:41,870
works in it works at
university of cancer but

1785
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:46,550
it's pushing towards
domestication of the

1786
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:50,390
dh in the land where i
mean in the where the

1787
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:52,530
research is coming
out from not just so

1788
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:54,970
you had worked with
um learning wood films

1789
01:31:54,970 --> 01:31:56,910
but just like we have
hollywood nollywood

1790
01:31:56,910 --> 01:31:59,870
films um where they
were not in digital form

1791
01:31:59,870 --> 01:32:03,250
so you had to go for
posters um banners and

1792
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:05,110
flyers you know
nigeria when we produce

1793
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:07,530
film we usually put the
posters on the streets

1794
01:32:07,530 --> 01:32:09,990
the new film is out
so from the poster

1795
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:12,870
you could know the
viewing station i don't

1796
01:32:12,870 --> 01:32:15,830
know if it's view
station here you know it

1797
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:17,230
should be viewing
station like where people

1798
01:32:17,230 --> 01:32:19,690
watch football or
sports so people also go

1799
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:23,510
to watch movies in in
the center not in your

1800
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:24,910
room not in your house
because you don't

1801
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:28,270
have the luxury so
from the posters and

1802
01:32:28,270 --> 01:32:32,410
banners on the street
um on electric posts

1803
01:32:32,410 --> 01:32:35,650
wherever they paste it
you know the time the

1804
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:37,310
show will be on viewing
just like in the

1805
01:32:37,310 --> 01:32:40,450
theater in in the west
theater you go to theater

1806
01:32:40,450 --> 01:32:43,150
too but this one is
like a a deal in a

1807
01:32:43,150 --> 01:32:45,230
small room that people
come together pay you

1808
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:47,590
pay then you you watch
it so he's trying

1809
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:51,370
to digitize um nollywood
pre maybe post post

1810
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:54,990
um civil war or post
-independence or pre

1811
01:32:54,990 --> 01:32:57,070
-independence was trying
to go through the

1812
01:32:57,070 --> 01:32:59,710
history of nonnywood in
nigeria and the second

1813
01:32:59,710 --> 01:33:01,590
project which seems
to be very interesting

1814
01:33:01,590 --> 01:33:05,710
is the um nigerian
literature in the

1815
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:08,210
markets we call it market
literature so there

1816
01:33:08,210 --> 01:33:12,250
are histories that um
connect the dots um

1817
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:15,350
be fortunate to be
1948 that was the first

1818
01:33:15,710 --> 01:33:18,430
african nigerian novel
would i say nigerian

1819
01:33:18,430 --> 01:33:20,950
novel not not the first
but i mean typical

1820
01:33:20,950 --> 01:33:23,410
of teens fall apart
which was a product

1821
01:33:23,410 --> 01:33:26,430
from out of darkness
joseph conrad it was a

1822
01:33:26,430 --> 01:33:29,010
ph it was an english
student from university

1823
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:30,910
of ibadan which was
formerly university of

1824
01:33:30,910 --> 01:33:35,330
london in nigeria
and she he read teens

1825
01:33:35,330 --> 01:33:37,910
fall apart sorry he read
heart of darkness and

1826
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:40,790
he was hungry the
way um joseph conrad

1827
01:33:40,790 --> 01:33:47,590
depicted africa as
hard as black i mean as

1828
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:50,970
darkness right yeah
yeah so in retrospect he

1829
01:33:50,970 --> 01:33:53,850
wrote his first novel
things fall apart uh

1830
01:33:53,850 --> 01:33:57,090
which seems to be
summary is saying we were

1831
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:59,330
we had our culture we
had our civilization

1832
01:33:59,330 --> 01:34:02,090
before you people came
before things fell

1833
01:34:02,090 --> 01:34:06,010
apart so and he took
that from um the poem

1834
01:34:06,010 --> 01:34:08,470
turning and turning
in this welding uh um

1835
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:11,550
second coming second
coming that's from yates

1836
01:34:11,550 --> 01:34:14,530
yeah wb yates so it
took the line this fall

1837
01:34:14,530 --> 01:34:16,730
apart from the second
coming um that we

1838
01:34:16,730 --> 01:34:19,350
already had our life
going on we have local

1839
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:21,550
administrations we
have cultural practices

1840
01:34:21,550 --> 01:34:23,930
they were stable you
might call it non

1841
01:34:23,930 --> 01:34:26,330
-civilized but they were
stable they were they

1842
01:34:26,330 --> 01:34:28,650
were documented but
things fell apart when

1843
01:34:28,650 --> 01:34:31,710
the ****** came and
introduced civilization

1844
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:34,010
christianization and
commercialization the

1845
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:36,200
three cities we usually
study in history and

1846
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:38,350
that changed the dynamic
so his own goal for

1847
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:41,010
yoko james was to
document the pamphlet

1848
01:34:41,010 --> 01:34:44,430
literature from the
market um there were small

1849
01:34:44,430 --> 01:34:47,570
pamphlets people drop
it in the market um

1850
01:34:47,570 --> 01:34:49,770
maybe poems and thereabouts
before we now have

1851
01:34:49,770 --> 01:34:53,110
a standard um form of
writing so that's also

1852
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:55,850
serves as a bridge
building project even

1853
01:34:55,850 --> 01:34:59,290
though he's a western
scholar trained in canada

1854
01:34:59,290 --> 01:35:02,610
works um universal
of cancers, but it's

1855
01:35:02,610 --> 01:35:05,070
going back to see what
it can document and

1856
01:35:05,070 --> 01:35:08,270
digitize, maybe with
resources from the West or

1857
01:35:08,270 --> 01:35:12,130
resource or no resources
or manpower. And it

1858
01:35:12,130 --> 01:35:14,830
runs the African DH
symposium every year to

1859
01:35:14,830 --> 01:35:17,830
support that kind of
move. So DH in the global

1860
01:35:17,830 --> 01:35:20,590
South will usually
be a bridge in those

1861
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:23,730
spectrum, I've explained,
if we're captured.

1862
01:35:25,890 --> 01:35:30,110
wow that's immense
what you just described

1863
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:32,370
because it kind of
moves through time

1864
01:35:32,370 --> 01:35:34,710
but if you're following
a scholar who is

1865
01:35:34,710 --> 01:35:38,590
like organized african
digital humanities

1866
01:35:38,590 --> 01:35:42,370
and that's so
important um because

1867
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:48,710
it's the bridge that
he and others like him

1868
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:52,370
and you right like
our building seems

1869
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:57,630
to be about, yeah,
using those tools that

1870
01:35:57,630 --> 01:36:01,710
started in the West
or the North, however

1871
01:36:01,710 --> 01:36:05,290
you describe that,
and changing them,

1872
01:36:05,530 --> 01:36:07,630
educating with them
even before you

1873
01:36:07,630 --> 01:36:09,950
change them, but
also in the process

1874
01:36:09,950 --> 01:36:12,130
of educating,
recognizing the

1875
01:36:12,130 --> 01:36:16,770
problems, and deciding
with other people

1876
01:36:16,970 --> 01:36:21,050
what you want to do
and what matters now

1877
01:36:21,250 --> 01:36:25,990
yeah do you think it's
our bridges are in

1878
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:32,230
danger or vulnerable
to um i'll just stop

1879
01:36:32,230 --> 01:36:34,690
with like vulnerable
and if so to what yeah

1880
01:36:37,150 --> 01:36:40,710
yeah go ahead no
no i think like

1881
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:43,390
it's just i
don't like to be

1882
01:36:43,390 --> 01:36:44,770
a little fight
completely AI.

1883
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:48,490
I think sometimes
that could be a

1884
01:36:48,490 --> 01:36:51,390
bridge destroyer
because it takes a lot

1885
01:36:51,390 --> 01:36:53,850
of the communications
that happen.

1886
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:56,420
Okay, what can be
a communication?

1887
01:36:56,790 --> 01:36:59,050
The communication,
like creating

1888
01:36:59,050 --> 01:37:01,050
multicultural
projects and

1889
01:37:01,050 --> 01:37:04,950
just add an AI
and the AI will

1890
01:37:05,130 --> 01:37:08,210
be the... Oh, so AI, our
bridges are vulnerable

1891
01:37:08,210 --> 01:37:10,810
to AI. Yeah, okay.
i think in that way

1892
01:37:10,810 --> 01:37:13,790
in a way that that
for for making these

1893
01:37:13,790 --> 01:37:16,090
bridges you need
communication you need to see

1894
01:37:16,090 --> 01:37:18,930
each other kind of
and i feel like it's

1895
01:37:18,930 --> 01:37:21,870
dangerous when we start
like only seeing the

1896
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:25,170
machine kind of um we
have been talking a lot

1897
01:37:25,170 --> 01:37:28,590
about the human resource
the human factor

1898
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:31,990
in everything we do the
human factor in minimal

1899
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:36,490
computing um how the
human factor have

1900
01:37:36,490 --> 01:37:40,030
changed our way to work
like how we thinking

1901
01:37:40,030 --> 01:37:42,790
about others how we
seeing other people work

1902
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:47,130
in projects and and
how we we like like

1903
01:37:47,130 --> 01:37:48,850
your example that you
said like i want to

1904
01:37:48,850 --> 01:37:52,330
participate in that
edition and and but that

1905
01:37:52,330 --> 01:37:54,990
was because you were like
you have an inquitude

1906
01:37:54,990 --> 01:37:57,210
and you have another
one like communicated

1907
01:37:57,210 --> 01:37:59,370
the same and you were
like oh we need to

1908
01:37:59,370 --> 01:38:01,690
do something about it
and then jumping into

1909
01:38:02,050 --> 01:38:05,590
and and felix also
was like working in in

1910
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:08,530
archives and going
around the globe like

1911
01:38:08,530 --> 01:38:10,750
learning and going
into conference and

1912
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:13,930
trying to manage a
way to communicate to

1913
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:18,410
showcase what he was
doing and and and in in

1914
01:38:18,410 --> 01:38:20,850
my case also i was
like looking for like

1915
01:38:20,850 --> 01:38:23,410
how how i could share
this knowledge and

1916
01:38:23,410 --> 01:38:26,190
how this could be
meaningful for for a group

1917
01:38:26,190 --> 01:38:29,670
of people that
usually overlook on um

1918
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:33,210
in in the term of
technology i mean the

1919
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:38,130
world of broadcasting
so and so i feel like

1920
01:38:40,350 --> 01:38:44,650
sometimes like ai
cool it's like could

1921
01:38:44,650 --> 01:38:47,070
replace that communication
because it will

1922
01:38:47,070 --> 01:38:49,470
give you all the
answers and yeah it's

1923
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:52,430
so authoritative
someone else yes so

1924
01:38:52,430 --> 01:38:55,630
confident yeah yes
so confident and will

1925
01:38:55,630 --> 01:38:58,990
give you the answers
you want not the the

1926
01:38:58,990 --> 01:39:01,930
one that that you
need to hear kind of

1927
01:39:02,570 --> 01:39:07,510
like we could ask chat
gpt to write a paper

1928
01:39:07,510 --> 01:39:10,410
discussion on the
like did you feel that

1929
01:39:10,410 --> 01:39:13,290
tension because i did
like oh take these

1930
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:16,290
bullet point notes and
at any point any of

1931
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:17,970
the three of us and
i thought of this i

1932
01:39:17,970 --> 01:39:19,950
thought seriously
because we're under like

1933
01:39:19,950 --> 01:39:22,870
really high pressure
time constraint would you

1934
01:39:22,870 --> 01:39:25,990
turn this into a
dialogue and between me

1935
01:39:25,990 --> 01:39:27,670
and felix and consuelo
and then we would

1936
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:29,890
look at it and like
there was a part of me

1937
01:39:29,890 --> 01:39:33,110
that was like i was
almost like no like it

1938
01:39:33,110 --> 01:39:35,130
was sort of erupting
from my gut like we

1939
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:38,770
must not do that but
like why do i why do i

1940
01:39:38,770 --> 01:39:41,770
feel that way i think
we have good reason

1941
01:39:41,770 --> 01:39:46,730
but like for this
article to be re-digested

1942
01:39:46,730 --> 01:39:50,210
for us by ai was like
that's why we were

1943
01:39:50,210 --> 01:39:54,830
so upset right like
oh my god and and that

1944
01:39:54,830 --> 01:39:57,350
thing that that is the
communication we we

1945
01:39:57,350 --> 01:40:01,130
don't say we we're
not complacent to you

1946
01:40:01,130 --> 01:40:03,870
to say like whatever
the other one wants to

1947
01:40:03,870 --> 01:40:06,890
hear we're like sharing
different perspective

1948
01:40:06,890 --> 01:40:12,430
or view and i feel
like ai will be like

1949
01:40:12,430 --> 01:40:15,390
a little bit of
******* that part of

1950
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:19,430
building our bridges
like making um artificial

1951
01:40:20,010 --> 01:40:22,850
kind of like artificial
bridges not human

1952
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:27,130
vision yes and and we
need that and i think

1953
01:40:27,130 --> 01:40:29,570
that that's dangerous
because i feel

1954
01:40:29,570 --> 01:40:32,140
like we're finally
opening we're finally

1955
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:34,210
talking about it i feel
like in the last 10

1956
01:40:34,210 --> 01:40:37,230
years we started like
like finally i mean

1957
01:40:37,230 --> 01:40:39,170
a little bit more but
finally saying like

1958
01:40:39,170 --> 01:40:42,770
hey like we are making
like the humanities

1959
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:46,650
from the periphery
kind of and i feel like

1960
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:51,310
that hey could be
lost so quick when we

1961
01:40:51,310 --> 01:40:54,830
we stop here and we
stop like looking for

1962
01:40:55,370 --> 01:40:58,870
asking questions to
someone that will not

1963
01:40:58,870 --> 01:41:01,730
necessarily give us
what we want who is

1964
01:41:01,730 --> 01:41:03,870
machine or something
whose machines get to

1965
01:41:03,870 --> 01:41:08,710
remember who we are
yes yes and and and i

1966
01:41:08,710 --> 01:41:12,430
feel that like they go
tell me i don't know

1967
01:41:12,430 --> 01:41:14,130
they could tell me
that chile has i mean

1968
01:41:14,130 --> 01:41:16,850
it has the best internet
in in the continent

1969
01:41:16,850 --> 01:41:20,870
and they call it and
that's um conosur

1970
01:41:20,870 --> 01:41:24,070
**** i forgot the oh
oh my god sorry i um

1971
01:41:24,730 --> 01:41:28,990
the the conosur the
the little triangle

1972
01:41:28,990 --> 01:41:31,050
behind i cannot remember
this is happening

1973
01:41:31,050 --> 01:41:32,790
when you're like working
in multiple languages

1974
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:38,710
you're bilingual
not bilingual um but

1975
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:40,550
what it meant is like
chile have in other

1976
01:41:40,550 --> 01:41:43,070
american countries
chile has like the best

1977
01:41:43,070 --> 01:41:45,170
internet but that doesn't
mean that the best

1978
01:41:45,170 --> 01:41:46,650
connection but that
doesn't mean that

1979
01:41:46,650 --> 01:41:48,870
that connection is the
best in all of chile

1980
01:41:49,390 --> 01:41:51,970
so the ai will tell
me like oh yeah you

1981
01:41:51,970 --> 01:41:53,550
know how like the
engine they have like

1982
01:41:53,550 --> 01:41:54,890
the most advanced
they have the most

1983
01:41:54,890 --> 01:41:57,300
bandwidth it's gonna
be everything you

1984
01:41:57,300 --> 01:41:59,770
want to you could
have 4k images on your

1985
01:41:59,770 --> 01:42:01,250
web page and every
you will be able to

1986
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:03,730
see it everywhere but
then you get there

1987
01:42:04,230 --> 01:42:07,950
and you go to like
the north or you go to

1988
01:42:07,950 --> 01:42:09,870
the southern part and
then you don't have

1989
01:42:09,870 --> 01:42:12,890
like even like like 45
minutes from the main

1990
01:42:12,890 --> 01:42:16,270
city uh for the main
cities like you don't

1991
01:42:16,270 --> 01:42:18,380
have that reliable of
internet necessarily

1992
01:42:18,380 --> 01:42:21,390
so you will not be
able to see it and how

1993
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:23,670
you know that it's
happening if you talk

1994
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:28,110
with someone that is
in there you open your

1995
01:42:28,110 --> 01:42:30,690
eyes and you find
someone that will keep

1996
01:42:30,690 --> 01:42:33,390
you sincere answers
and then you're able to

1997
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:36,270
make a robust project
that will be able to

1998
01:42:36,710 --> 01:42:39,530
cross the digital
barriers i don't know

1999
01:42:39,530 --> 01:42:42,470
how to call it but
they they will be

2000
01:42:42,470 --> 01:42:44,770
able to jump the gap
in the digital barriers

2001
01:42:44,770 --> 01:42:46,650
that exists in our
title the digital

2002
01:42:46,650 --> 01:42:51,210
divide we experience
those divides locally

2003
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:56,550
and i feel like
like that happened

2004
01:42:56,550 --> 01:42:58,810
when you lose the
heat you will have yes

2005
01:42:59,070 --> 01:43:00,830
the best internet
and then you will

2006
01:43:00,830 --> 01:43:01,810
find that it's
not the best

2007
01:43:01,810 --> 01:43:04,470
internet everywhere
it's a proportion

2008
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:13,290
following podcast
is intended for

2009
01:43:13,290 --> 01:43:17,970
mature audiences
oh my god my

2010
01:43:17,970 --> 01:43:19,870
cell phone just
put that on okay

2011
01:43:21,190 --> 01:43:22,530
well it's almost
like a little

2012
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:25,150
example the podcast
is intended for

2013
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:27,870
mature audiences with

2014
01:43:27,870 --> 01:43:29,310
potentially poor internet

2015
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:33,150
oh my god yes i just
have it like far away

2016
01:43:33,150 --> 01:43:35,590
i don't know what
what was that what do

2017
01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:36,850
you mean about this
that i hear like

2018
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:40,430
probably cd sir is
hearing us you know that

2019
01:43:41,410 --> 01:43:47,690
we're training siri i
think we probably have

2020
01:43:47,690 --> 01:43:52,030
enough material i i
think the next stage

2021
01:43:52,030 --> 01:43:56,010
of this where you know
we will have a recording

2022
01:43:56,010 --> 01:44:00,030
um but we also um i'm
gonna upload it into

2023
01:44:00,030 --> 01:44:03,130
kaltura the little
example i sent was like

2024
01:44:03,130 --> 01:44:05,530
maybe 10 minutes of
material but like i

2025
01:44:05,530 --> 01:44:07,850
recorded after a class
so this this will take

2026
01:44:07,850 --> 01:44:09,650
longer but i don't
think it's gonna take

2027
01:44:09,650 --> 01:44:12,570
days and stuff like it
it works year every year

2028
01:44:12,570 --> 01:44:17,410
but even that like
if we look at this i

2029
01:44:17,410 --> 01:44:18,730
don't know if you had
a chance to look at it

2030
01:44:18,730 --> 01:44:23,010
but like if i share my
screen real quick and

2031
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:26,110
like are you seeing as
we're probably seeing

2032
01:44:26,110 --> 01:44:28,640
a whole bunch of things
right now but like

2033
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:31,790
it's this is the zoom
transcript in its

2034
01:44:31,790 --> 01:44:33,990
data format i was actually
going to give this

2035
01:44:33,990 --> 01:44:35,770
to my students because
we could make a little

2036
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:38,250
homework exercise
out of processing it

2037
01:44:38,250 --> 01:44:40,530
because like it's it's
regularly patterned

2038
01:44:40,530 --> 01:44:43,430
and stuff but we're going
get a very long string

2039
01:44:43,430 --> 01:44:47,630
like this and um i
think we forgot the

2040
01:44:47,630 --> 01:44:49,790
idea that we had but
which was like when we

2041
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:53,670
start talking say consuelo
or alisa we forgot

2042
01:44:53,670 --> 01:44:56,130
because conversation
is like that but like

2043
01:44:56,130 --> 01:44:58,490
you know i can go
through and rip out the

2044
01:44:58,490 --> 01:45:00,490
little time stamps but
we're gonna get like

2045
01:45:00,490 --> 01:45:03,850
this flow of straight
and and then we can

2046
01:45:03,850 --> 01:45:06,830
also watch ourselves but
i kind of am wondering

2047
01:45:06,830 --> 01:45:09,430
okay what is the
writing of this going to

2048
01:45:09,430 --> 01:45:14,370
be because we have like
this textured document

2049
01:45:14,610 --> 01:45:17,130
very textured i'll
just move it onto the

2050
01:45:17,130 --> 01:45:21,250
screen now um google
wants me to pay more

2051
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:23,310
money you can see that
look at that pay money

2052
01:45:23,310 --> 01:45:24,850
and i'm like no i
will not pay money for

2053
01:45:24,850 --> 01:45:27,030
you i will delete things
before i pay money

2054
01:45:30,630 --> 01:45:33,330
yeah that is a problem
we get the zoom bar

2055
01:45:33,330 --> 01:45:36,130
away but like we have
i think this structure

2056
01:45:36,130 --> 01:45:38,490
like let's talk about
that for a minute

2057
01:45:38,490 --> 01:45:41,590
because this might help
us with like okay what

2058
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:43,650
we're pounding we're
mashing a thing together

2059
01:45:43,650 --> 01:45:46,930
like maybe it's like
a fabric but like i

2060
01:45:46,930 --> 01:45:50,430
came up with i wrote a
very silly introduction

2061
01:45:50,430 --> 01:45:52,650
that was meant to help
cite people we need

2062
01:45:52,650 --> 01:45:54,890
we should cite more
people i reached for

2063
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:58,010
the one issue right
but like we now have

2064
01:45:58,010 --> 01:46:00,830
digital black atlantic
to cite we have jeffrey

2065
01:46:00,830 --> 01:46:03,970
rockwell's book on
voyant we have um like

2066
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:06,890
like grab your favorite
people and like you

2067
01:46:06,890 --> 01:46:09,230
have projects like the
digital nollywood and

2068
01:46:09,230 --> 01:46:11,570
stuff but like we can
patch that stuff in

2069
01:46:11,570 --> 01:46:14,310
the way we do citations
maybe not even up here

2070
01:46:14,310 --> 01:46:16,510
but like should we
leave that maybe you

2071
01:46:16,510 --> 01:46:18,730
spoke of them in
conversation so i think some

2072
01:46:18,730 --> 01:46:22,230
of that should go in
here and like you know

2073
01:46:22,230 --> 01:46:26,370
we poke in the footnotes
but like um we we

2074
01:46:26,370 --> 01:46:29,570
need to can i just
delete this but like like

2075
01:46:29,570 --> 01:46:32,310
i almost wonder if we
should pick this up

2076
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:35,290
and move it to a
separate document once we

2077
01:46:35,290 --> 01:46:40,770
get our like yes um like
maybe we need a folder

2078
01:46:40,770 --> 01:46:44,310
but then so i think
between you and me

2079
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:47,530
consuelo and i i like i
think we poked at this

2080
01:46:47,530 --> 01:46:50,090
document a little bit
over the week and i

2081
01:46:50,090 --> 01:46:51,750
think felix came in
toward the end and did

2082
01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:55,190
it but like we need to
keep pieces like this

2083
01:46:55,350 --> 01:46:56,310
probably

2084
01:46:57,140 --> 01:46:58,450
yeah I think like we

2085
01:46:58,450 --> 01:46:59,870
could move around those

2086
01:47:02,170 --> 01:47:05,890
yeah it's going to
be a mess is what's

2087
01:47:05,970 --> 01:47:09,230
going to happen I feel
like we because it's

2088
01:47:09,230 --> 01:47:11,010
a Friday I don't
think they're going to

2089
01:47:11,010 --> 01:47:13,470
be editing during
the weekend right we

2090
01:47:13,470 --> 01:47:15,770
can't turn this
around overnight no we

2091
01:47:15,770 --> 01:47:17,890
literally can't I mean
should we write to

2092
01:47:17,890 --> 01:47:21,310
them and say no and
tomorrow I have I have

2093
01:47:22,850 --> 01:47:27,050
the I'm hosting Douglas
Day so I will be the

2094
01:47:27,050 --> 01:47:30,600
whole morning out and
then I have to come

2095
01:47:30,670 --> 01:47:33,090
back and then I have
a meeting there then

2096
01:47:33,090 --> 01:47:36,450
so yesterday I mean
Friday it's looking hard

2097
01:47:37,970 --> 01:47:41,570
yeah I have my annual
faculty evaluation

2098
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:45,430
that I have to write
70% of it tonight but

2099
01:47:45,430 --> 01:47:47,410
after this meeting I
go to campus I meet

2100
01:47:47,410 --> 01:47:49,810
with students and I
have I'm meeting with

2101
01:47:49,810 --> 01:47:52,690
students all day I'm
gonna get home at 6 and

2102
01:47:52,690 --> 01:47:54,770
have to do my faculty
evaluation if I want

2103
01:47:54,770 --> 01:47:58,190
to keep my job well
I know it's like we

2104
01:47:58,190 --> 01:48:00,190
have to do the annual
and I put it off and

2105
01:48:00,190 --> 01:48:01,430
put it off and put it
off and it's like oh

2106
01:48:01,430 --> 01:48:04,030
my god yeah so like we
cannot give them back

2107
01:48:04,030 --> 01:48:08,740
an article tomorrow
like I think we just

2108
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:11,010
know we feel right I
don't think they're

2109
01:48:11,010 --> 01:48:13,170
gonna be doing anything
during the weekend

2110
01:48:13,170 --> 01:48:16,830
and we could like push
it to monday manage

2111
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:20,620
push it to monday and
i'll find a little bit

2112
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:27,310
of room there i i
feel like um we have a

2113
01:48:27,310 --> 01:48:30,310
lot and maybe i don't
think formatting is

2114
01:48:30,310 --> 01:48:32,530
most of what we do
now because we what we

2115
01:48:32,530 --> 01:48:35,930
spoke is important
yeah yes so and like i

2116
01:48:35,930 --> 01:48:37,750
wonder if we can put
like sort of topic

2117
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:40,590
headings on things like
we sort of have those

2118
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:47,990
and yeah okay so so
so i feel like yeah um

2119
01:48:49,670 --> 01:48:52,970
weekend's gonna be busy
uh what if i make a

2120
01:48:52,970 --> 01:48:57,310
google drive folder
and then we can make

2121
01:48:57,310 --> 01:48:58,670
multiple documents in
here because i think

2122
01:48:58,670 --> 01:49:02,430
we need to pick up the
that ai pooped in our

2123
01:49:02,430 --> 01:49:04,790
document it we're going
to pick that up and

2124
01:49:04,790 --> 01:49:07,790
move it aside we're
writing right like so

2125
01:49:07,790 --> 01:49:10,170
we will have an idea
yeah and then like we

2126
01:49:10,170 --> 01:49:12,830
keep the structured
stuff and maybe should

2127
01:49:12,830 --> 01:49:16,630
i just put the transcript
directly in like

2128
01:49:16,630 --> 01:49:19,550
paste it in like without
the time stamps or

2129
01:49:19,550 --> 01:49:21,950
something like that like
just put it directly

2130
01:49:21,950 --> 01:49:25,760
in and then we
turn that into yeah

2131
01:49:25,850 --> 01:49:28,470
something pretty i think
you will yeah we could

2132
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:30,170
turn into something
pretty we could move it

2133
01:49:30,170 --> 01:49:32,630
around we could put
like subtitles maybe

2134
01:49:32,630 --> 01:49:35,870
we don't need to
necessarily cut and we could

2135
01:49:35,870 --> 01:49:37,750
put an introduction like
this is a discussion

2136
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:40,910
we put like like we
put subtitles like

2137
01:49:40,910 --> 01:49:43,050
a title we could put
a little description

2138
01:49:43,050 --> 01:49:45,570
of like goals in there
but we could say like

2139
01:49:45,570 --> 01:49:46,970
if you don't want to
read and you want to

2140
01:49:46,970 --> 01:49:48,630
read everything you could
like read everything

2141
01:49:48,630 --> 01:49:50,950
as a conversation
oh so we do a little

2142
01:49:50,950 --> 01:49:54,310
summary yeah so kind
of like like we could

2143
01:49:54,310 --> 01:49:56,610
we could continue
because there is a lot of

2144
01:49:56,610 --> 01:49:59,180
continuity in the
discussion that is happening

2145
01:49:59,180 --> 01:50:01,390
we could make
subtitles when we think

2146
01:50:01,390 --> 01:50:03,530
like the topic is
changing and it's evolving

2147
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:05,850
so we could change
the title put out your

2148
01:50:05,850 --> 01:50:08,730
description of what
is coming kind of and

2149
01:50:09,110 --> 01:50:12,890
maybe we could add and
we could add like an

2150
01:50:12,890 --> 01:50:14,930
introduction like a
little place where we say

2151
01:50:14,930 --> 01:50:16,770
like this is a
discussion it's meant to

2152
01:50:16,770 --> 01:50:18,870
be read like all together
but if you want to

2153
01:50:18,870 --> 01:50:21,510
go jump into the specific
section if you're

2154
01:50:21,510 --> 01:50:24,150
like interested in
like discussion on AI,

2155
01:50:24,370 --> 01:50:27,560
like you could
jump into like the

2156
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,570
other. And I feel
like that could

2157
01:50:29,570 --> 01:50:31,830
help us with
the transitions.

2158
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:33,510
We already know we're

2159
01:50:33,510 --> 01:50:34,890
adding two new questions,

2160
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:37,010
right? You know,
at least two, if

2161
01:50:37,010 --> 01:50:38,670
not three, actually
three, right?

2162
01:50:38,670 --> 01:50:40,110
Three, three
questions, yeah.

2163
01:50:40,230 --> 01:50:42,410
Yeah, so we add those
in and those are

2164
01:50:42,410 --> 01:50:44,730
gonna give some new
shape to it. I think it's

2165
01:50:44,730 --> 01:50:47,330
gonna be a beautiful
thing to see, yeah.

2166
01:50:47,590 --> 01:50:49,630
So we're gonna try
to push for this

2167
01:50:49,630 --> 01:50:51,830
to send out on
Monday. do we write

2168
01:50:51,830 --> 01:50:53,460
to them or do we
just stay quiet

2169
01:50:55,630 --> 01:50:57,830
we can stay quiet

2170
01:51:01,390 --> 01:51:04,190
because the key
thing is they can't

2171
01:51:04,190 --> 01:51:08,190
afford to miss Humanity
Computing's chapter

2172
01:51:08,190 --> 01:51:11,290
from the Gnosa we
are taking hostage

2173
01:51:11,810 --> 01:51:14,790
because they really
want this chapter that's

2174
01:51:14,790 --> 01:51:17,810
true I know they
wrote us and they make

2175
01:51:17,810 --> 01:51:20,570
the effort for it so
we can just keep quiet

2176
01:51:20,890 --> 01:51:23,330
so let's let's keep
quiet but we do have a

2177
01:51:23,330 --> 01:51:25,550
beautiful thing yeah
that's nice i always

2178
01:51:25,550 --> 01:51:27,630
feel bad keeping quiet
but okay if they bite

2179
01:51:27,630 --> 01:51:31,610
us like hey i don't
see it uh then we can

2180
01:51:31,610 --> 01:51:34,790
respond yes yes like i
have a question about

2181
01:51:34,790 --> 01:51:38,240
this too should we talk
frankly about our own

2182
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:40,950
experience with ai in
putting this chapter

2183
01:51:40,950 --> 01:51:43,190
together do we want
to keep because it's

2184
01:51:43,190 --> 01:51:45,950
there in the conversation
right do we keep it

2185
01:51:45,950 --> 01:51:50,190
or do we want to edit
it out we go I feel

2186
01:51:50,190 --> 01:51:53,090
like we could keep it
sort of yes like we could

2187
01:51:53,090 --> 01:51:55,590
keep like that attention
like yeah we know

2188
01:51:55,590 --> 01:51:58,170
it's there like kind
of like it's like we

2189
01:51:58,170 --> 01:52:00,290
we found ourselves
actually very upset with

2190
01:52:00,290 --> 01:52:02,150
it at one point in
preparing this because

2191
01:52:02,150 --> 01:52:04,130
we thought one thing
of it and it provided

2192
01:52:04,130 --> 01:52:07,190
us another and it it
was stealing our voices

2193
01:52:07,190 --> 01:52:09,650
I think that's an
appropriate thing to say

2194
01:52:09,650 --> 01:52:13,010
it was stealing our
yeah like the tone of it

2195
01:52:13,010 --> 01:52:16,530
the questions the
memory of it yeah so so

2196
01:52:16,530 --> 01:52:18,710
we could talk about it
i feel like we could

2197
01:52:18,710 --> 01:52:21,350
we could add in like
on our frustrations and

2198
01:52:21,350 --> 01:52:24,810
our i don't know where
we could even put it

2199
01:52:24,810 --> 01:52:27,170
toward the like app when
we do the ai section

2200
01:52:27,170 --> 01:52:29,150
like maybe it comes
at the end of it or

2201
01:52:29,150 --> 01:52:31,850
it's like a little
addendum about like our

2202
01:52:31,850 --> 01:52:34,610
experience in designing
this because it's a

2203
01:52:34,610 --> 01:52:37,030
little time capsule
of our moment in 2026

2204
01:52:37,030 --> 01:52:40,630
and like the use of zoom
and all of it no and

2205
01:52:40,630 --> 01:52:42,830
also i feel like it's
it's a great example

2206
01:52:42,830 --> 01:52:45,690
of like we wanted to
participate into the

2207
01:52:45,690 --> 01:52:50,290
world of ai and like and
we see it failing just

2208
01:52:50,290 --> 01:52:53,870
one way it fails you
know in the walls and

2209
01:52:53,870 --> 01:52:56,870
see like maybe sometimes
we need to rely

2210
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:59,670
on our minimal computing
tools they're like

2211
01:52:59,670 --> 01:53:05,730
more they're more nice
to us yeah i think

2212
01:53:05,730 --> 01:53:08,740
like we could do that
i feel like uh the in

2213
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:11,870
general the dialogue
it's like very relatable

2214
01:53:12,290 --> 01:53:15,470
and i feel like we want
to keep that up i'm

2215
01:53:15,470 --> 01:53:17,690
i'm thinking strictly
this is an introduction

2216
01:53:17,690 --> 01:53:20,640
that probably students
are gonna read yes

2217
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:25,830
so i'm thinking that
um minimal computing

2218
01:53:27,930 --> 01:53:31,390
like it's it's dry if
you don't like speak

2219
01:53:31,390 --> 01:53:35,270
like like if we don't
say what what we think

2220
01:53:35,270 --> 01:53:36,910
it's minimal computer's
gonna be oh so

2221
01:53:36,910 --> 01:53:39,410
you're making your own
robots kind of like

2222
01:53:39,410 --> 01:53:41,850
like it could go right
there you know you're

2223
01:53:41,850 --> 01:53:43,770
making tiny robots
that are more efficient

2224
01:53:43,770 --> 01:53:45,290
like no no no that's
not what we're talking

2225
01:53:45,290 --> 01:53:49,530
about and i feel like
it's inviting like

2226
01:53:49,530 --> 01:53:51,480
minimal computer is
supposed to be inviting

2227
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:54,170
to to everybody to
participate where we're

2228
01:53:54,170 --> 01:53:57,330
to think about it so
so i think it's it's

2229
01:53:57,330 --> 01:54:02,140
part of this academic
relatable discussion

2230
01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:04,370
yeah i think my students
should read this

2231
01:54:04,370 --> 01:54:06,250
whatever it turns out
to be now that you

2232
01:54:06,250 --> 01:54:08,570
mention it yeah like
everybody's students

2233
01:54:08,570 --> 01:54:10,430
should read this yeah
and i think that's

2234
01:54:10,430 --> 01:54:12,890
probably what yeah they
want for this book too

2235
01:54:12,890 --> 01:54:16,830
what they want to so
yeah so that so let's

2236
01:54:16,830 --> 01:54:19,270
write this for our
students and our people

2237
01:54:19,270 --> 01:54:22,550
yeah and i feel like
they're gonna maybe

2238
01:54:22,550 --> 01:54:24,350
they're gonna like
tuck them to the heart

2239
01:54:24,350 --> 01:54:27,010
that we felt the same
temptation and the on

2240
01:54:27,010 --> 01:54:31,390
like ai and we have
inspiration and why we

2241
01:54:31,730 --> 01:54:35,150
yeah yeah what we took
and i feel like that

2242
01:54:35,150 --> 01:54:40,590
made us relatable also
like yeah all right

2243
01:54:40,590 --> 01:54:45,610
well um is that do you
think we'll be ready

2244
01:54:45,610 --> 01:54:48,150
i think we're ready
yes we have this

2245
01:54:48,150 --> 01:54:51,190
recording in the recording
we trust should i

2246
01:54:51,190 --> 01:54:55,150
shut the recording off
it has to be shut off

2247
01:54:55,150 --> 01:54:56,870
in order for us to
get it so here we go

2248
01:54:56,870 --> 01:55:00,830
and hit stop recording
stop cloud reporting
