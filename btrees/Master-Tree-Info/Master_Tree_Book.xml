        <desc>The baldcypress tree is the classic tree of southern swamps. There, in its native
            habitat, it displays a peculiar habit of raising conical "knees" from its roots. The
            function of these growths is something of a mystery, although some believe it is a way
            to help the roots get oxygen. This tree dwells in swamps because it out-competes most
            other trees on such sites. To the surprise of many, the baldcypress does quite well when
            planted in the right soil in yards or along streets and is a beautiful specimen tree. It
            has been grown successfully in cities as far north as Milwaukee and on dry Texas hills. </desc>

            Franklinia has never been observed growing in any other place than along the Altamaha
            River. In a return trip in 1773, William Bartram collected seed from this site and
            brought it back to the Bartram's garden in Philadelphia where the tree was successfully
            grown. This tree has been extinct in the wild since 1803. </desc>

            leaves stay a vibrant red all year long. The tree grows 15 to 25' tall. The Japanese
            word "momiji" is sometimes applied to this tree in its native land. The word is said to
            have two meanings, both of them appropriate for the description of this wonderful tree:
            "baby's hands" and "becomes crimson leaves." 'Atropurpureum' means dark purple. </desc>

        <desc>Japanese Umbrella Pine is named for its elegant shape and cascading green needles. It
            usually grows to 25' and is a slow grower. Japanese umbrella trees (Sciadopitys
            verticillata) are small, strikingly beautiful trees that never fail to draw attention.
            Called “koya-maki” in Japan, the tree is one of Japan’s five sacred trees. These richly
            textured conifers are rare and expensive in nurseries because they grow slowly and it
            takes a long time to grow a sapling large enough to sell. In the landscape, it can take
            100 years for a sapling to reach mature size. </desc>
